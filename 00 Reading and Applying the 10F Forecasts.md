# 00	Reading and Applying  	the 10F Forecasts

[The Forecast Structure](#the-forecast-structure)  
[Applying the Forecasts](#applying-the-forecasts)

Each 10F Forecast maps a fundamental shift already underway—it's not a prediction of what might happen, but an analysis of directional changes individuals and organisations must navigate. 

These Forecasts are designed for leaders and teams within organisations navigating systemic uncertainty—NGOs, multilaterals, corporations, government agencies and philanthropies operating across borders. They aim to create useful intelligence for navigating these transitions. 

## Who Writes a 10F Forecast

Each 10F Forecast was written collaboratively by several authors from the 10F Consortium and represents a blend of voices, points of view and insights from across a dozen contributors. They don't necessarily reflect unanimity; they represent consensus. They are also informed by the broader contributions and ideas of a group spread across six continents that collectively spans strategic foresight, complexity science, sustainability, geopolitical intelligence, AI/technology policy, urban innovation, systems thinking and narrative/cultural strategy, with deep experience advising governments, UN agencies, foundations and major institutions on navigating uncertainty and systemic change.

## The "From-To" Frame

Every Forecast is organised around a "From-To" statement that broadly captures a paradigm shift. The "From" describes the assumptions and arrangements that shaped the previous era. The "To" describes the emerging reality replacing them. These are transformations visible in current evidence that will define the operating environment through 2035\.

## The Forecast Structure {#the-forecast-structure}

### Abstract

This introductory section gives a one to two sentence abstract of the Forecast’s content.

### Key Domains

Each Forecast lists each of 15 domains it is related to. This shows how a single transformation ripples across multiple systems and allows readers to navigate across Forecasts by domain. For example, if your organisation operates primarily in finance, you can look across Forecasts listing the financial architecture domain to see how different transformations (e.g., dollar dominance, transparency regimes, migration flows) intersect within that space. The domain tags make the interconnections visible.

### Bottom Line

This is the essential takeaway. This section tells you what the shift means.

### Old Assumptions

The beliefs and arrangements that governed the previous system. They are becoming unreliable guides for strategy, even if they worked reasonably well under prior conditions.

### Emerging Norms

The new operating principles replacing old assumptions. These describe how power, value and risk are being reorganised.

### The Transformation

How and why the shift is happening. This section traces mechanisms rather than simply describing outcomes and covers what pressures created the conditions for change, what accelerated the transition and how different actors are responding.

### Strategic Blind Spots

Risks and dynamics that organisations might be missing. These identify where normal analysis fails to capture important second-order effects or where assumptions about system behaviour may prove dangerously wrong.

### Global System Implications

How the transformation affects broader international arrangements—what collapses, what emerges and what contradictions become unmanageable.

### AREAS Strategic Landscape

Rather than sorting actors into fixed categories (like allies or adversaries), each Forecast maps strategic positions using the AREAS framework:

* **Architecting**: Actors actively designing and building the new system—setting rules, establishing infrastructure and shaping what emerges  
* **Resisting**: Actors working to prevent, slow, or reverse the transformation because they benefit from existing arrangements or see the emerging system as threatening  
* **Exploiting**: Actors taking advantage of the gaps, friction and arbitrage opportunities the transformation creates. This includes legitimate value creation in newly relevant spaces  
* **Avoiding**: Actors seeking to stay outside the transformation's direct effects by building parallel systems or maintaining old arrangements in isolated pockets  
* **Shaped**: Actors experiencing the transformation without the capacity to architect, resist, exploit, or avoid it and being forced to adapt to conditions created by others

Positions aren't permanent. The same actor can architect one transformation while resisting another, or shift positions as circumstances change. This dynamic positioning matters more than identity for understanding how the transformation will unfold.

### Scenario Pathways

Each Forecast broadly explores three trajectories to help organisations plan for different futures:

* **Transformation**: The shift proceeds to a new equilibrium. Systems reorganise around emerging norms. Winners and losers crystallise.  
* **Stagnation**: Contradictory pressures prevent resolution. Old and new systems coexist uncomfortably. Organisations face persistent operational challenges without clear direction.  
* **Collapse**: Systems fail faster than alternatives emerge. Chaos creates both danger and unexpected openings as formal structures fragment.

These are provocations which illustrate possible futures each shift might bring about. Organisations should develop strategies that function across all three.

### Adaptive Strategies

For each scenario, the Forecasts suggest one example approach for different actors:

* **Organisations**: How institutions might position themselves  
* **Communities**: How collective groups might build resilience  
* **Individuals**: How people might navigate personal choices  
* **Advocates**: How those seeking to influence outcomes might operate effectively

These are starting points for strategic conversation within your own context—a trigger to imagine actions to navigate these different futures.

### Current Signals

Each Forecast includes concrete evidence—recent developments, policy changes, or institutional behaviours—that demonstrate the transformation is already underway. Signals include links to sources, so readers can verify claims and track developments.

## Applying the Forecasts {#applying-the-forecasts}

The 10F Forecasts won't tell you what's going to happen. They'll help expand peripheral vision and provide language to bring others along.

They're designed to provide:

* **Orientation:** a map, not a route  
* **Better questions:** not a playbook  
* **Shared language:** if others are using it, you can too  
* **Agency:** where there may be leverage points for action

## Finding Your Entry Point

**Forecasts describe shifts that may already feel familiar**—things you've sensed but haven't had language for, or patterns you've noticed but couldn't quite name.

**There’s no need to read every forecast.** Start with one or two that connect to what your organisation is already navigating. Use the Key Domains to find them.

**Read the Bottom Line first.** Does it resonate? If so, go deeper. If not, move on. Trust your instincts about what's relevant.

## Bringing Others In

Sensemaking is a social process. The shifts these Forecasts describe don't happen to individuals; they happen to systems. Understanding them takes more than one perspective. 

* **Cognitive:** We don't know what we think until we say it out loud. Articulating to others surfaces assumptions we didn't know we held.  
* **Perspectival:** Each person sees different signals, weighs different risks, notices different patterns. Pooling perspectives helps catch blind spots.  
* **Legitimacy:** An insight you hold alone feels like a hunch. The same insight shared and tested by a group becomes actionable.  
* **Commitment:** People are more likely to act on what they helped shape. Conclusions handed down don't stick the way conclusions arrived at together do.  
* **Strategic Planning:** During annual or multi-year planning cycles, use the Old Assumptions section to audit your current strategy with your team. Ask: which assumptions are we still operating on that a Forecast identifies as changing?  
* **Catalyse Conversation:** Use the Bottom Line or a single Scenario Pathway to open a discussion with colleagues who aren't yet seeing the shift. The Forecasts provide a way into the conversation that doesn't require you to be the one making the claim.  
* **Scenario Exercises:** The three Scenario Pathways provide ready-made inputs for group scenario planning. Stress-test a specific decision together: would your approach hold up across all three? What would you do differently under each?  
* **Team Workshops:** Use the AREAS framework to map your organisation's current position then consider the positioning of partners, competitors and counterparts. Ask together: is this position deliberate? What would trigger a shift? Who in our network is architecting this shift—and should we be closer to them?  
* **Cross-Organisational Dialogue:** When working with partners across sectors or geographies, use a shared Forecast as common ground. Ask: which Strategic Blind Spots apply to us all?

## Charting Transformation Using AREAS

You can find more information on 10F’s AREAS Framework, as well as a tool to apply it, here:

* AREAS Framework Introduction ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1ekbRIHNG8sTtSrzbSgQiU9un_dfU8fQBlq6G6JRLNrs/edit))  
* AREAS Canvas Toolkit ([PDF download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NCMmTDs7KwQDp4L7qvhYXIRantLrWACQ/view?usp=drive_link))

## Working Across Forecasts

Individual Forecasts describe single transformations, but the shifts interact. Once you've identified two or three Forecasts relevant to your context, look for:

* **Reinforcing Dynamics** where one shift accelerates another  
* **Tensions** where emerging norms in one Forecast conflict with another  
* **Compounding Risks** where Strategic Blind Spots overlap

## Join the Conversation

These Forecasts are dynamic—shaped by an ongoing conversation among practitioners who are also currently navigating these shifts. If something resonates, or you're seeing something we're not, we want to hear from you. You can email us at [info@10fconsortium.org](mailto:info@10fconsortium.org)
