## Abstract

The global shift from durable alliances to transactional arrangements rewards optionality over commitment. Those who cannot maintain multiple partnerships simultaneously find themselves locked into arrangements others can exit at will.

## Key Domains 

Trade Systems, Global Supply Chains, Security Alliances & Military Technologies, Financial Architecture, Digital Information Ecosystems, Civil Society & Democratic Institutions 

## Bottom Line 

As multilateral reliability recedes and great-power alignment fades, states meet near-term needs through narrow, bilateral arrangements rather than treaty-grade pacts. Verification and reversibility displace value alignment. Corridor optionality, maintaining multiple routes and partners, becomes bargaining power. After shocks, parties suspend, tighten and rapidly renegotiate instead of litigating. Short, reversible memoranda of understanding (MOUs) become the default as treaty-grade, values-informed deals survive only as exceptions. What were once special relationships become **strategic situationships**: deliberately under-defined partnerships that maintain ambiguity about depth, duration and exclusivity. This ambiguity is not slippage but strategy. Legibility becomes liability, the party that can be pinned down loses leverage to the party that cannot.

## Old Assumptions

* **A stable Liberal Order:** Post-war US-European leadership sets rules and norms that extend beyond the transatlantic bloc via security ties and market access.  
* **Values Anchor Trust:** Shared liberal democratic norms are expected to secure cooperation, reduce monitoring costs and sustain long-horizon commitments.  
* **Partnerships Are Structural, Not Transactional:** "Special relationships" and long-term alliances between countries and companies are built for permanence. Commitment signals strength, consistency builds reputation, trust compounds through repeated cooperation.  
* **Treaties Signal Endurance:** Slow ratification and ceremony build symbolic trust, underwriting large projects and buffering commitments across political cycles.  
* **Regional Forums Suffice:** Consensus-based institutions coordinate divergent interests through dialogue and de-escalation rather than enforcement.  
* **Geopolitical Frameworks Are a Foundation:** Business leaders in developed economies assume alliances and institutions remain predictable. Political risk is for frontier markets, not core relationships.

## Emerging Norms 

* **Transactional Arrangements Replace Values-based Commitments:** State deals narrow to specific deliverables with short timelines and easy exits.  
* **Legacy Arrangements Fragment Unevenly:** Western frameworks like Five Eyes hollow out—labels persist, trust erodes, information flows become conditional. Non-Western arrangements actively reinvest as geopolitical hedges.  
* **Corridor Redundancy Replaces Efficiency:** States and firms keep multiple pre-cleared routes and backup partners, trading optimisation for the ability to reroute fast.  
* **Parallel Infrastructure Becomes Standard:** Businesses build and maintain separate compliance, payment rails and data systems for incompatible jurisdictions.  
* **Commerce and Statecraft Fuse:** Business leaders hold dual roles across incompatible systems, normalising the combination of government and private roles and interests. The question “is this a business deal or a diplomatic move?” increasingly has no answer—because the distinction no longer holds.  
* **Influence Shifts from Institutions to Individuals:** Personal brands maintain portable legitimacy across contradictory relationships.  
* **Niche Ideologies Enter Mainstream Policy:** Tech accelerationism, crypto-libertarianism, and China-hawk nationalism move directly into government through venture capital and tech appointments, bypassing conventional policy development.

## The Transformation 

For three decades after the Cold War, the global system operated through deepening integration. Broadly speaking, countries joined institutions assuming rules would stabilise. Businesses concentrated supply chains for efficiency, and partnerships were structural rather than transactional. The Washington Consensus wasn't just economic policy, it was a relationship model rewarding commitment and loyalty—invest in your military and receive Article 5 protection under NATO, or go through years of pain to harmonise regulations in return for trading market access via WTO. Political leaders could assume alliances provided predictable frameworks. Deep institutional trust, backed by shared democratic values and routine cooperation, was considered both morally superior and strategically sound.

This logic has broken under repeated shocks. The 2008 financial crisis exposed vulnerabilities in interconnected systems, highlighting fissures within the EU, for example. Russia's annexation of Crimea and then war with Ukraine demonstrated that geopolitical risk wasn't consigned to history. Brexit signalled fractures within the liberal democratic core. Then came the acceleration: Donald Trump's first term normalised treating alliances as negotiable. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed supply chain fragility. US-China decoupling, sanctions as routine tools and semiconductor export controls made clear that optionality is more necessary than integration in terms of international business relationships.

This pivot now shows up concretely as strategy, even if it was initially driven by economics and ideology. To keep flows moving amid instability, actors increasingly use non-binding instruments: the EU, facing the divergent interests of 27 member states, now applies at least twice as many bilateral soft law tools with third countries as binding international agreements. Trust shifts from shared values to verifiable performance. This increasingly entails shorter tenure, narrower scope and reversible commitments. What was once “special relationships” becomes “strategic situationships”—deliberately undefined partnerships that maintain ambiguity about depth, duration and exclusivity. Situationships aren't failures of diplomacy—they're its new grammar.

What emerges is a world where commitment itself becomes a source of fragility. Trust erodes even in historic partnerships: Five Eyes members withhold intelligence from each other, with the UK suspending Caribbean sharing and the US stamping critical reports “No Foreign Distribution,” or NOFORN—while simultaneously, regional frameworks like Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) reinvest with next-generation capabilities. 

Business leaders now occupy simultaneous government and private roles, with venture capitalists joining administrations while maintaining investment funds. Countries seeking expanded or continued regional influence mix public diplomacy and private deals to gain leverage with partners. Ports, plants, processors and preferential partnerships, the latter always present in statecraft, now operate without the constraining fiction of universal rules. The same logic extends to invisible infrastructure: data corridors, energy interconnectors, payment rails and network access. Operational control over electrons, packets, or kilowatts creates the same leverage as control over shipping lanes or rare earth mining and processing. 

Companies spend billions undoing deep single-system integration, creating parallel compliance systems not for efficiency but survival. States maintain multiple incompatible partnerships simultaneously, invoking frameworks when useful, while hedging through alternatives. The capability to play multiple games at once, switching between them as conditions shift, becomes essential. Commitment signals rigidity, optionality signals sophistication.

The costs of this shift in relationship management accumulate. Coordination overhead rises as more agreements cycle more quickly and expectations of similar deals rises among current and future partners. Accountability gaps widen as memoranda of understanding, executive orders, framework agreements, joint statements and bilateral protocols bypass legislative scrutiny. Access becomes uneven—actors with resources maintain multiple options, while others remain locked to single partners. Managing this complexity becomes a competitive advantage in itself.

## Strategic Blind Spots

* **Institutional Inertia:** Leaders assume long-standing arrangements (Five Eyes, NATO, WTO) gain authority through longevity, missing that trust erodes even in durable frameworks as members withhold information and selectively comply.  
* **Commitment Premium:** Conventional wisdom treats exclusive partnerships as strategic advantage, while the new reality rewards maintaining multiple incompatible relationships simultaneously.  
* **Values Shortcut:** Elites assume shared democratic norms reduce transaction costs, missing that trust has shifted from ideological alignment to verifiable performance as the basis for cooperation.  
* **Integration Lock-In:** Business and political leaders assume deep integration creates irreversible dependencies, overlooking that actors spend billions engineering reversibility through parallel systems and pre-cleared alternatives.  
* **Optionality Treated as a List, Not a Capability:** Having multiple partners or routes on paper is not the same as being able to smoothly reroute in time—they must be continually tested and assured, given the strategic value that is riding on them. Failure comes with switching costs. Alternatives must be kept “warm”—licences current, integration tested, staff trained, regulatory approvals made portable—or they exist only on paper.   
* **Presence as Control:** Western observers expect infrastructure investment and military bases to follow imperial patterns, missing that influence now flows from operating systems under contract rather than owning territory.  
* **Employment Binary:** Organisations treat work as permanent positions or contingent labour, missing that fragmented, project-based relationships are becoming the structural norm—not a transitional state or worker preference.

## Global System Implications

* **Gatekeepers Gain Leverage:** Operators of routes and authorities that issue licences/recognitions can speed or stall activation. Their decisions set timelines and prices, where the rulebook of one jurisdiction or platform hands off to another.   
* **Resilience Becomes Unequal:** Actors with cash and teams keep multiple options warm and certified, smaller players cannot. The gap shows up as more interruptions and deeper lock-in for those with the least bargaining power.   
* **Shock Dynamics Change:** Fragmentation can contain contagion within spheres. Price spikes and delays accumulate unless strong cushions absorb them.   
* **Multilateral Roles Are Reconfigured:** Less energy goes to grand, universal deals, with more going to toolkits that verify, certify and recognise across systems. The most useful shared assets become fast recognition processes, common test suites and escrowed audit rights.   
* **The End of Integration as Strategy:** The capability to operate across multiple, increasingly incompatible systems simultaneously becomes more valuable than the efficiency gains from choosing one.

## AREAS Strategic Landscape

### Architecting

* Major powers operate as if every alliance comes with conditions and exit clauses, making "we might leave" the standard starting position in any negotiation  
* China shifting from sovereign loans to build-operate contracts that secure leverage without ownership  
* Gulf states designing simultaneous partnerships spanning incompatible Western and Chinese systems  
* Financial technology firms building modular compliance infrastructure for rapid jurisdictional switching  
* Venture capitalists embedding directly in government while maintaining fund positions  
* Companies engineering duplicate production and compliance systems across incompatible markets—building parallel manufacturing facilities and regulatory infrastructure not for efficiency but as insurance against tariffs, sanctions and jurisdictional fragmentation

### Resisting

* EU institutions pushing binding treaties while counterparts prefer reversible MOUs  
* Intelligence communities defending deep sharing relationships against selective compliance  
* Professional diplomatic corps protecting treaty-based frameworks which requires their expertise  
* Legacy alliance advocates arguing that hollowed trust destroys capabilities faster than it creates flexibility  
* Small open economies (especially in Europe) resisting deglobalisation as it eliminates their primary competitive advantage of access to international trade and cross-border investment

### Exploiting

* Broker states leveraging regulatory arbitrage between incompatible systems  
* Verification and compliance industries selling code-switching capability as premium product  
* Fractional executives managing simultaneous, contradictory client relationships  
* Infrastructure operators setting prices at handoff points between jurisdictional systems  
* Data brokers capitalising on regulatory gaps and mismatches across fragmenting regulatory regimes  
* Individual influencers with portable audiences wielding disproportionate leverage: shifting narratives, brokering demographic access and extracting rents from platforms and campaigns without institutional accountability

### Avoiding

* Regional frameworks like the Five Power Defence Arrangement (FPDA) reinvesting in next-generation shared capabilities  
* Mutual aid networks maintaining commitment-based relationships outside market logic  
* Long-horizon research collaborations requiring sustained partnerships that situationships can't deliver  
* Criminal networks exploiting jurisdictional gaps and regulatory fragmentation for arbitrage opportunities in contraband, cybercrime and financial laundering  
* Local currencies and community finance bypassing transactional relationship norms

### Shaped

* Smaller states locked into single-partner dependencies while larger actors maintain alternatives  
* Workers churning through portfolio careers without building institutional knowledge or security  
* Children in climate-vulnerable regions inheriting compound crises (food insecurity, displacement, collapsing infrastructure) as states prioritise optionality over long-term investment in resilience  
* Civil society organisations forced to adapt to short-term, project-based funding as donors shift from long-term institutional support to conditional grants tied to measurable deliverables  
* Migrants and refugees whose legal status depends on specific bilateral agreements that collapse when governments shift to conditional partnerships  
* Populations bearing accountability gaps as agreements bypass legislative scrutiny  
* Small businesses absorbing coordination overhead they lack resources to manage

## Short Scenario Pathways

### Functional Volatility

Situationship logic becomes a normalised operating principle across all domains. New institutions emerge designed for optionality rather than permanence: treaties with automatic sunset clauses, employment platforms optimised for portfolio careers, alliances structured as subscription services. International treaties look more like licensing agreements and terms of service—basic (negotiated rates), premium (expedited customs), and enterprise (regulatory harmonisation). Trust mechanisms shift entirely from identity to performance, enabling cooperation between actors sharing nothing ideologically but capable of verifying each other's outputs in real time. Commitment itself is redefined as maintaining multiple parallel relationships rather than exclusive loyalty. Defence arrangements rely less on firm terms and more on “What have you done for me lately?” standards. Rights or access are treated like services.

Countries maintain parallel cloud certifications across US-aligned (AWS, Azure), China-aligned (Alibaba, Huawei) and sovereign-stack systems—switching workloads based on which relationship offers better terms that quarter. Payment rails fragment into competing clubs: SWIFT-connected, CIPS-connected and other bridge systems that translate between them.  A company's “corridor portfolio,” which establishes the data routes, energy feeds and payment systems it can access simultaneously, becomes as strategically important as its physical supply chain.

But verification has its own scaling problem. Overhead grows non-linearly as relationships multiply, and verification systems require their own trust infrastructure—who certifies the auditors? The question is not whether verification can replace trust for specific transactions, but whether it can scale to the volume situationship logic demands. This equilibrium holds while verification technology keeps pace with complexity. When verification costs rise faster than the value of optionality, pressure builds toward consolidation—either into fewer, deeper relationships within emerging blocs, or collapse into low-trust deadlock where verification costs more than cooperation is worth.

**Adaptive Strategies:** 

* **Organisations:** Invest in verification infrastructure and relationship management capacity. Competitive advantage comes from the ability to maintain more simultaneous partnerships than rivals while delivering measurable performance across all of them.  
* **Communities:** Build portable trust markers that translate across systems. Local reputation must be legible to outside partners without requiring deep context.  
* **Individuals:** Develop code-switching fluency and portfolio careers spanning multiple sectors. Single-employer dependence becomes a vulnerability, breadth of relationships becomes security.  
* **Advocates:** Shift from demanding institutional commitment to designing verification systems that make cooperation possible without it. Influence flows to those who can certify trustworthiness across incompatible frameworks.

### Zombie Institutions

Actors become trapped between old frameworks that no longer function and new arrangements too fragile to scale. Countries maintain zombie alliances—technically operative but practically useless—while unable to formalise new partnerships that remain deliberately ambiguous. There may be a treaty, but no one really recognises it any more. Companies drain capital managing parallel systems across incompatible regulatory regimes, and legal departments explode in size. Workers churn between gigs without building expertise, firms cycle through contractors without developing institutional knowledge. Diplomatic corps shed career experts. The inability to commit produces a low-trust equilibrium where no one is willing to invest in anyone else. 

Innovation stalls as resources flow to hedging rather than building. Digital services get squeezed out as data infrastructure deals aren’t maintained. AI models and payment services get blocked due to sanctions or security decisions, but remain accessible through basic workarounds. Shadow intermediaries proliferate. Deals are agreed but never operationalised. Public frustration grows as institutions continue to demand loyalty they no longer reciprocate. The gap between institutional rhetoric and operational reality becomes impossible to ignore, but no actor has sufficient incentive to build replacements.

**Adaptive Strategies:** 

* **Organisations:** Identify which legacy frameworks still deliver value and which are pure overhead. Quietly build informal operating relationships while maintaining formal compliance with zombie structures.  
* **Communities:** Create local workarounds that function regardless of whether official systems engage. Expect nothing from institutions but maintain access in case they occasionally deliver.  
* **Individuals:** Build skills and relationships outside institutional channels. Credentials from zombie institutions lose value; demonstrated capability and personal networks matter more.  
* **Advocates:** Document the gap between institutional promises and performance. The case for alternatives strengthens as dysfunction becomes undeniable—alternatives must be ready when legitimacy finally collapses.

### Free-Rider Cascade

The erosion of commitment reaches a threshold where essential systems require coordination but no actor accepts the obligations to provide it. A major crisis—pandemic, financial contagion, climate emergency, or supply chain failure—demands collective response, but situationship logic has hollowed out the capacity to act effectively. Countries withhold information, companies prioritise self-preservation, coordination falls apart quickly. Nations that maintained multiple partnerships precisely to avoid deep obligations now discover that none of those partners will share critical information without reciprocity guarantees they are unable to provide—the ambiguity that preserved optionality now blocks the flows the crisis demands. 

Corridors for trade, data and finance are increasingly temporary and unreliable. One day you have access to renewable power and AI processing from a partner country, the next day it’s cut due to an unrelated supply chain issue. Optionality only functions when someone maintains underlying infrastructure—when everyone free-rides simultaneously, the system fails.

The crisis reveals that transactional relationships cannot generate the collective goods that made them possible in the first place. Recovery requires rebuilding trust from scratch—but the skills and institutional memory for doing so have atrophied. What emerges is smaller, more local and less capable than what came before. Some systems rebuild smaller and more local, others see opportunistic actors impose new order on the wreckage.

**Adaptive Strategies:** 

* **Organisations:** Identify which collective goods operations depend on and invest in their maintenance before crisis, even without reciprocity guarantees. Being the actor who kept infrastructure alive creates leverage in recovery.  
* **Communities:** Build self-sufficiency in essentials now. When cascades hit, external support arrives late or not at all. Local capacity to provide food, shelter, care and security determines who survives the gap.  
* **Individuals:** Cultivate deep local ties alongside broader networks. When systems fail, immediate geography matters most. Know the neighbours—transactional relationships cannot substitute in emergencies.  
* **Advocates:** Preserve institutional memory and coordination skills. Post-collapse, the scarcest resource is knowledge of how to rebuild collective capacity. Those who remember how cooperation worked become essential to recovery.

## Current Signals 

**Signal 1: Non-binding instruments replace formal treaties at scale**

The EU now signs at least twice as many soft law tools as binding agreements. States bypass treaty processes for shorter, narrower, more reversible arrangements, prioritising speed and flexibility as well as reduced scrutiny.

* The 2023 EU-Tunisia migration MoU committed €105 million in border control funding flows without the legal safeguards, independent monitoring, or procedural protections that formal agreements would require. [https://timep.org/2025/05/01/externalizing-migration-control-to-the-mena-region-tunisia/](https://timep.org/2025/05/01/externalizing-migration-control-to-the-mena-region-tunisia/)  
* 2025 MoU between the US and Thailand signalled cooperation on critical mineral supply chains, trade and investment in extractive industries.

**Signal 2: Historic alliances experience unprecedented trust breakdowns**

Five Eyes members withhold critical information from each other while regional frameworks outside Western blocs are renewed. Trust migrates from ideological alignment to verifiable performance metrics. The pattern extends to scientific cooperation as well.

* Intelligence sharing on issues such as threats from transnational white nationalist activities has reportedly broken down among key international partners. [https://www.cfr.org/blog/five-eyes-intelligence-sharing-has-failed-combat-white-nationalist-terrorism](https://www.cfr.org/blog/five-eyes-intelligence-sharing-has-failed-combat-white-nationalist-terrorism)  
* In 2025, European Commission President von der Leyen announced plans to create an EU intelligence unit that would gather information from member states' national services.

* In space, two parallel lunar programs—NASA's Artemis Accords (60 signatories) and China-Russia's ILRS (11 countries)—now recruit partners through incompatible frameworks.

**Signal 3: Infrastructure becomes operational leverage, not territorial control**

China shifted from sovereign loans to public-private partnerships where developers build then operate infrastructure for fees. Influence flows from infrastructure operation, not ownership, keeping host governments formally sovereign while securing long-term management rights.

* Chinese firms hold a majority stake in the PPP operating the Lekki Deep Sea Port in Nigeria, gaining fees while letting the Nigerian government retain control. [https://www.logupdateafrica.com/trade/nigeria-in-talks-with-china-to-boost-marine-and-blue-economy-ties-1356439](https://www.logupdateafrica.com/trade/nigeria-in-talks-with-china-to-boost-marine-and-blue-economy-ties-1356439)  
* UAE’s DP World operates ports and logistics across 12 African countries as it seeks to enhance the Emirates’ commercial and geopolitical influence in Africa. [https://www.theafricareport.com/346561/uae-dp-world-makes-a-play-for-africa/](https://www.theafricareport.com/346561/uae-dp-world-makes-a-play-for-africa/)

**Signal 4: Expensive redundancy is engineered across all infrastructure types** 

Firms unwind decades of supply chain optimisation, building duplicate manufacturing, data centres, energy grids and financial messaging systems across incompatible regulatory regimes. What was wasteful inefficiency becomes an essential survival strategy as invisible infrastructure faces the same fragmentation and leverage dynamics as physical supply chains.

* 177 foreign financial entities have joined Russia’s System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS), its alternative to SWIFT, which it started developing as a result of post-Crimea sanctions. [https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20250403-25-countries-join-russias-payment-system-as-an-alternative-to-swift/](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20250403-25-countries-join-russias-payment-system-as-an-alternative-to-swift/)  
* Access to Starlink, a satellite Internet access company controlled by Elon Musk, has become a geopolitical leverage point in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. [https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-affected-as-starlink-suffers-global-outage/](https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-affected-as-starlink-suffers-global-outage/)  
* Amazon Web Services in China are operated by a Chinese data company, as a tradeoff for gaining access to the Chinese market.

* Automotive companies invested over $35 billion in the US to hedge supply chains and production in case of future tariffs or regulatory shifts.
