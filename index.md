# 10F Forecasts

Ten strategic forecasts mapping fundamental shifts already underway—not predictions of what might happen, but analyses of directional changes individuals and organisations must navigate through 2035.

---

## About 10F

These forecasts are designed for leaders and teams within organisations navigating systemic uncertainty—NGOs, multilaterals, corporations, government agencies and philanthropies operating across borders.

Each forecast was written collaboratively by several authors from the 10F Consortium and represents a blend of voices, points of view and insights from across a dozen contributors spanning strategic foresight, complexity science, sustainability, geopolitical intelligence, AI/technology policy, urban innovation, systems thinking and narrative/cultural strategy.
