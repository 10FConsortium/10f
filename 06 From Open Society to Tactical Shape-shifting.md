## Abstract

The old networks which were committed to social good efforts—working toward transparency, accountability and pluralism—are **shape‑shifting** by changing how they portray themselves publicly, and moving more of their activities and communications out of view.

## Key Domains

Trade Systems, Migration & Population Movements, Global Health Infrastructure, Social Values & Identity Systems, Civil Society & Democratic Institutions

## Bottom Line

Civil society worldwide is being forced to transform. ​Social sector institutions—universities, independent media, cultural organisations, advocacy NGOs and humanitarian agencies—were built for a ​world organised under a post-WWII ​rules-based order that, ​while flawed and exclusionary, was a comprehensible system for international engagement. Now these organisations, institutions and movements must fundamentally respond to increasingly hostile environments around climate disruption, extreme inequality, AI-driven technological change and consolidating authoritarian power across the US, India, Russia, China and elsewhere. Legal institutions and international agreements that once balanced power have been degraded and ignored.

Authoritarian governance, operating through state, corporate and transnational channels, is targeting the infrastructure of expression and dissent: academic freedom, investigative journalism, freedom of association, cross-border funding and the basic acceptance of facts. It threatens legal standing, withholds funds and threatens violence for non-compliance. Meanwhile, humanitarian and rights organisations must operate within the same systems ​that produce the harms they address.

These dynamics force civil society to remain visible enough to claim space, while becoming opaque enough to survive. This isn't a contradiction but a sequencing problem. Organisations are learning which aspects should be visible—when, to whom and for how long. To survive, they must shape-shift to meet those they serve, and connect with partners and funders in new ways, while reducing exposure to attack. Shape-shifting isn't selling out. It's sequencing—knowing which face to show, to whom, and when.

## Old Assumptions

* **Default to openness:** For decades, civil society argued for the value of openness: open meetings, public registration and routine collaboration with universities, media and courts.  
* **Democratic Norms Provide Protection:** Privileged actors assumed democratic procedures and independent bodies would resist authoritarian consolidation, and that institutional inertia favoured inclusion. Abuse of power, extortion and fear have overwhelmed core protections.  
* **Aspirational Standards Guide Accountability:** Imperfect commitments to transparency, evidence and basic rights created social and legal leverage by highlighting the gap between the promise of a better, more just world and the actual unjust practices of nations, businesses and organisations.  
* **Universal Organising Strategies:** Tactical strategies don’t expose everyone to the same risk. Race, gender, class, immigration status and prior surveillance histories produce different levels of threat.   
* **International Aid Infrastructure as Stable:** Aid systems were assumed to be flawed and paternalistic but durable, with mechanisms being debated to improve or reform them. 

## Emerging Norms

* **Shape‑Shifting Over Universal Strategy:** The universal playbook for civil society is now frequently ignored. Maintaining operational agility concerning status based on prior historical treatment and failing to maintain core values, leads to actively being complicit in harm.  
* **Risk Assessments of Visibility:** Civil society actors consider whether and how to carefully foreground public roles to trusted lower‑risk actors and shield higher‑risk members.   
* **Narrative Control as Survival Imperative:** Controlling the narrative about the world has become an essential tool for both existential and organisational survival.   
* **Belonging is a Battleground:** Consolidated authoritarian power shrinks the circle of inclusion and belonging. Survival incentives are engineered into prisoner’s dilemma dynamics that reward complicity and punish non-aligned identities.   
* **Normality as a Mask:** Administrative continuity increasingly masks substantive erosion—organisations maintain operational functions while core values become negotiable and capacity drains away. Institutions keep their names while losing their missions.   
* **Support as Coercion:** Authoritarians are exploiting the destabilisation and degradation they foster. Debt relief, jobs and small status gains attract those from targeted communities, turning them into agents of the machine.

## The Transformation

The current assault on civil society is a generational-scale counter‑reformation against the promise of open, pluralistic societies. It has been building for decades, but gained more traction after the financial collapse of 2008–09 and the backlash against Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring. There is a shared tactical repertoire, branding free expression as terrorism, politicising funding, repressing and taking over media, extorting and capturing universities, gatekeeping procurement and using AI data‑driven surveillance and blacklisting. Authoritarian countries study and legitimate one another’s moves; the effect is a global ratchet. As examples, India’s approach to regulating CSOs and Hungary’s media/education capture became exportable blueprints.

Simultaneously, the problem‑space changed. Environmental, political, economic and technological breakdowns interlock in a polycrisis. AI has wormed its way into the substrate of decision‑making faster than regulation can define harms​ or advocates can address them​. For example, the Trump administration's ImmigrationOS platform now combines data from Treasury, IRS, census and immigration databases to shape enforcement decisions, with 27 out of 105 DHS AI use cases classified as "rights-impacting," yet operating with limited oversight​. 

Black-box governing algorithms evade oversight and erode legitimacy​: Public sector AI systems make high-stakes decisions about liberty, welfare and benefits while remaining largely opaque even to system engineers, with trade secret protections preventing disclosure of algorithmic logic. ​Tech‑finance stacks control budgets, talent and data that were once distributed across hundreds of NGOs. "Ethics Initiatives" are ornamental and rarely reach code or contract, where power is instantiated​. 

University AI ethics boards issue principles while procurement departments sign surveillance contracts, as the University of California discovered when balancing AI adoption against protecting sensitive student, research and medical data. The assault​ on humanitarian aid escalated as the US explicitly and visibly joined authoritarian coordination​, with the overnight dismantling of USAID that will result in millions of deaths. Counterweights to oppression are failing as attacks branding community groups as terrorists and economic coercion structures force vulnerable populations to choose between enforcement work and survival. 

Authoritarian projects have succeeded by playing the long-game. They have spent time, money and energy for decades, undermining the legitimacy of courts, media, universities and mechanisms of international cooperation. Civil society has tried to use narrative saturation and strategic talent placement to promote openness and plurality in political and cultural spheres. The fundamental tension persists: "How does an open movement go underground?" when operating in shadows contradicts a movement's essential nature. 

Yet early movers are already demonstrating what shape-shifting looks like in practice: Egyptian NGOs are registering as law firms and consultancies to evade restrictions. The Belarus Solidarity Foundation has relocated its operations across jurisdictions with alternative money transfer systems. Some organisations are maintaining distributed data repositories in multiple countries and movements are operating parallel tracks of visible protests. 

## Strategic Blind Spots

* **Polarisation Framing:** “Political polarisation” is a biased framing, in that it puts the burden on people who are often being abused, exploited or ignored to find “middle ground” with a group of radicalised oppressors.   
* **Trusting Institutions to Hold the Line:** Assuming universities would defend academic freedom, that media organisations would resist rather than capitulate and that legal processes and systems provide protection against authoritarianism has not held up.  
* **Seeing Events in Isolation:** Each individual country's descent into authoritarianism is often explained by reference to its own history, political dynamics, or cultural traits. Regimes learn from and enable each other through permission structures and tactics.   
* **Underestimating Collapse Speed:** Most people believe that systems that took decades to build would erode gradually rather than be dismantled overnight. Institutions might still persist administratively long after they have lost the capacity to affect reality.

## Global System Implications

* **Losing Sight of a Democratic "North Star":** For centuries, dominant economic, racial, and class hierarchies—especially white and Global North power structures—have shaped the boundaries of societies. Modern social movements are pushing back against those hierarchies.  
* **The Power of Narrative Control:** Who controls the historical narrative, the reality of lived experience, belonging and what counts as "truth," are fundamentally shifted.  
* **Decoupling from the US Aid Machine:** With the US and European aid systems contracting and being dismantled, organisations and communities face forced collapse.   
* **Multilateralism in Crisis:** The UN faces significant challenges and questions about its continuing relevance in addressing major conflicts. The UN's challenges reflect broader questions facing multilateral institutions about their effectiveness and adaptation to shifting global power dynamics.  
* **Belonging Becomes Explicitly Conditional:** As nations explicitly treat populations as stratified assets, civil society organisations lose their ability, and are potentially at risk of being prosecuted for advocating for marginalised communities.


## AREAS Strategic Landscape

### Architecting

* Regimes building new permission structures in which their actions legitimise additional repression in other states.  
* Governments and institutions creating enforcement recruitment programs, university funding threats and budget pressures that force difficult compromises where survival requires participating in oppression.  
* Journalism and media creating narrative infrastructure that only airs approved grievances from dominant groups.  
* Educational curricula being rewritten to control anti-critical history campaigns, ensuring power structures remain "heroes of history, not the villains" across cultural contexts.

### Resisting

* Sub-national governments threatening to withdraw funding from institutions which accept authoritarian deals that compromise values.  
* Pro-democracy and climate demonstrators finding sustained visibility by maintaining public pressure, despite the risks.  
* Groups transitioning to alternative legal structures, moving offshore, adopting risk-stratified strategies. This maintains function while evading regulatory capture.  
* Storytellers and advocates constructing alternative histories as cooperative media, community archives and digital storytelling networks reclaim the means of description.  
* Systems developing sophisticated protection for high-risk organising, drawing on historical resistance models while adapting to surveillance technology and modern authoritarian tools.  
* Communities organising with materials scavenged from the wreckage of institutions that once claimed to represent them.

### Exploiting

* Enforcement systems making debt forgiveness, loan relief and other enticements a prisoner's dilemma for those struggling to survive.  
* Institutions compromising their principles by trading academic freedom for institutional survival.  
* Organisations with flawed but functional systems positioning themselves as gatekeepers with their knowledge of both formal and informal channels.  
* Digital spaces becoming coordination hubs where visibility strategies are negotiated, providing infrastructure while building network power.  
* Organisers guiding shape-shifting transitions, arbitraging knowledge of multiple operating modes across national contexts.

### Avoiding

* Organisations founding legal structures that bypass traditional NGO scrutiny and evading immediate regulatory capture.  
* Nonprofits moving abroad entirely, universities are establishing satellite campuses, international organisations are distributing operations across jurisdictions  
* Organising groups moving to encrypted platforms not yet captured, using privacy tools, building communication networks outside surveillance reach—from Telegram, to Signal, to mesh networks.  
* Local, relationship-based support systems operating outside formal organisational structures, building cooperative forms that don't depend on government recognition or international funding.  
* Communities operating informal networks independent of official aid infrastructure building resilience through self-organisation.  
* Many organisations survive not by growth but by shedding visibility. In authoritarian contexts, concealment becomes a mode of endurance.

### Shaped

* People depending on aid systems, malaria drugs, contraceptives, or refugee camp heating shaped by geopolitical decisions made thousands of miles away.   
* Centuries-old institutions forced into capitulation calculations as academic freedom is crushed and the ability to produce independent knowledge are systematically undermined.  
* People forced underground regardless of movement strategy, bearing a disproportionate cost of visibility.  
* Youth facing "prison guard or prisoner" choices globally, as debt burdens make enforcement recruitment rational and economic structures offering no good options beyond participating in oppression.  
* People having their collective stories rewritten by authoritarian centres, struggling to maintain authentic self-description against framing backed by state power and captured media.

## Scenarios

### Like Water

Civil society organisations adopt distributed, multi-structure models to survive under global authoritarian pressure. Public-facing wings absorb attention and pressure, protecting vulnerable data, people and logistics. A humanitarian organisation might temporarily re-form as a film company for on-location shooting while secretly delivering aid, or hold a scientific conference to provide vital mutual aid and information.

Organisations draw on historical resistance—from underground railroads, to Poland's Solidarity, to anti-apartheid movements—while innovating against modern surveillance. New mutual aid and cooperative models replace dependency aid systems, operating through relationship-based networks rather than formal hierarchies.

Stories and visions are as critical as infrastructure. Organisations generate narrative counter-infrastructures through non-traditional channels that evade capture: pirate podcasts, graffiti, local media cooperatives, and community storytelling projects maintain alternative records and challenge imposed narratives.

Many universities become refuge institutions, creating protected spaces for independent knowledge production. Cities, states and regional governments worldwide provide incentives for values-driven work and exclude organisations that capitulate to repressive forces, enabling above-ground organising while supporting underground networks.

The work is fragile and uneven. Legitimacy arises from proximity to lived experience, not institutional scale. Civil society operates through cracks in authoritarian edifices, preserving transparency and democracy as operational values even when structures must adapt to hostile environments.

**Adaptive Strategies:**

* **Organisations:** Develop dual-structure models with visible public work and protected core operations, creating organisational "airlocks"   
* **Communities:** Build "solidarity city" networks connecting urban areas across borders with shared standards and support systems   
* **Individuals:** Cultivate "code-switching" abilities to navigate between official and alternative systems, including fluency in multiple organising modes  
* **Advocates:** Create working examples of pluralistic organising that functions under authoritarian conditions while maintaining democratic values across cultural contexts

### Crisis, Contestation, and Control

Civil society remains caught in unresolved tension. Organisations haven't adapted fast enough to evade repression, but aren't destroyed either. Philanthropies fund high-visibility projects while avoiding real counter-power efforts. Money for acute disasters is ad hoc and disconnected. Success metrics like "beneficiaries reached" incentivise crisis responsiveness, ensuring perpetual emergency. Fragmentation prevents shared learning, forcing each organisation to reinvent solutions in isolation.

University leaders constantly shuffle between institutions, reversing predecessors' actions. Each faces similar pressures and compromises but cannot coordinate resistance or systematic transformation.

Aid infrastructure neither rebuilds nor fully disappears. Sporadic funding creates dependency without reliability—preventing total collapse but insufficient for stabilisation. Millions remain perpetually endangered, without comprehensive abandonment or functional reconstruction.

Impossible choices perpetuate for individuals and organisations. Young people from marginalised communities join enforcement units for economic survival. Economic coercion generates steady defections, undermining movement strength without breaking resistance entirely. Solidarity remains too costly for individual survival, yet collective survival is impossible without it.

Narrative battles continue without resolution. Cities and regions cannot establish lasting counter-narratives against national authority. Historical whitewashing advances through official dictates, agency renaming and oligarchic media alignment. Counter-memory persists only through scattered community archives.

Nearly five billion people remain under varying authoritarian pressure—a permanent state of contested control where civil society survives in diminished form but cannot thrive.

**Adaptive Strategies:**

* **Organisations:** Create "mobility infrastructure" that functions despite volatility, focusing on practical support systems rather than depending on political resolution  
* **Communities:** Implement local integration frameworks that operate regardless of national policy shifts, building resilience against electoral changes   
* **Individuals:** Develop multiple contingency plans and maintain connections across different organising networks globally, building personal resilience   
* **Advocates:** Shift from demanding systemic change to highlighting and documenting fundamental tensions through economic data and compelling narratives 

### On Top of Ruins

Cascading failures overwhelm adaptive capacity as multiple systems collapse simultaneously, more quickly than alternatives can emerge. Universities capitulate globally in rapid succession, creating a legitimacy crisis as centuries-old values vanish within years. Independent research becomes impossible, higher education is now purely vocational or ideological. In Pennsylvania, a prestigious state university replaces its Humanities department with a "National Virtue Training Academy" focused on conformity and mandated job skills.

Global aid infrastructure is completely dismantled, triggering cascading humanitarian catastrophes. Climate displacement accelerates without functional response, creating migration pressures that overwhelm remaining protection systems. When mega-drought hits South Africa, the international community manages only ad-hoc food drops, failing to fund a single durable community-led project.

The UN becomes essentially non-functional, a vestigial shell. Multilateral frameworks are replaced by bilateral or unilateral action, eliminating coordinated climate, security, or pandemic response.

Civil society is forced almost entirely underground or destroyed, with only scattered networks surviving in isolated pockets. Captured media and historical revision make younger generations believe authoritarian control is inevitable. Opposition becomes inconceivable. A former Hong Kong pro-democracy organisation now exists only as a tiny encrypted "Digital Genealogy Project," preserving independent data accessible only via the dark web. Recognition and belonging are entirely conditional on conformity, no aspiration toward pluralism remains in public life.

**Adaptive Strategies:**

* **Organisations:** Build crisis response systems through direct partnerships with affected communities globally, creating support networks that function without failed international frameworks   
* **Communities:** Establish "climate mobility corridors" and regional mutual aid networks connecting impacted areas to regions with capacity through community-to-community agreements, bypassing collapsed national and international systems   
* **Individuals:** Build resilient social networks across different systems and locations, developing skills valued in multiple contexts   
* **Advocates:** Promote bioregional governance models based on ecosystem capacity and local cooperation rather than political boundaries
