# 07	From Selective Migration to  	People as Asset Class

> **Context:** This is one of the [10F forecasts](00%20Reading%20and%20Applying%20the%2010F%20Forecasts.md). See also: [Understanding the Transformation](00%20One%20Game%20to%20Many%20Games%5F%20%20Understanding%20the%20Transformation.md) and the [AREAS Framework](00A%20The%20AREAS%20Framework%5F%20A%20Guide%20to%20Strategic%20Positioning.md).

## Abstract

Migration systems shift from implicit selectivity to explicit human asset classification via algorithmic scoring that stratifies mobility by economic value rather than rights.

## Key Domains

Migration & Population Movements, Civil Society, Social Values & Identity, Digital Information Ecosystems, Security Alliances & Military Technologies

## Bottom Line

Migration systems have always been selective and discriminatory, but operated through a mix of formal restrictions and informal flows, often maintaining a humanitarian facade. The facade is dropping. People are now processed as stratified assets, with mobility privileges determined by economic value, cultural “scoring,” security risk algorithms, skill categories and country of origin. Nations now openly engineer population inflows and outflows to maximise returns, with third-party detention becoming a profit centre and skills being treated as strategic resources trapped within alliance structures and subject to gatekeeping based on ethnonationalism and institutionalised xenophobia. This shift from implicit to explicit valuation of human capital represents a fundamental ethical transformation in how human movement is governed globally. Rather than enabling more humane management of immigration systems, technology is accelerating categorisation, control and exploitation.

## Old Assumptions

* **Rights-Based Frameworks Exist:** International agreements and human rights norms provided theoretical foundations for migration governance.  
* **Humanitarian Pretence Matters:** Migration systems balanced security concerns with at least nominal commitments to refugee protection and humanitarian assistance.  
* **Selective Systems Allow Exceptions:** While discriminatory in practice, many migration regimes contained irregular flows, provided for family reunification options and asylum safety valves.  
* **National Frameworks Predominate:** Nation-states set their own migration policies within international norms, or work within internationally agreed frameworks.

## Emerging Norms

* **Rights Frameworks Deteriorate:** Human rights standards erode as utilitarian approaches to population management normalise differential treatment.  
* **Digital Migration Stratification:** Parallel digital mobility systems stratify access with highly-skilled "convenience refugees" enjoying premium channels of movement.  
* **Human Capital Scoring Is Explicit:** Nations openly assess and score migrants based on combined economic output potential and perceived potential for social integration.  
* **Skills as Sovereign National Assets:** Critical expertise is now treated as strategic national property, with nations implementing "skill corridors" that trap talent within alliance structures, repatriation programs targeting diaspora experts and explicit controls on outward mobility for citizens with valuable knowledge.  
* **Privatised Migration Control Generates Profit:** Detention, biometric monitoring and deportation become major profit centres for contractors.  
* **Bilateral Trumps Multilateral:** Nation-to-nation agreements replace global frameworks, treating populations as tradable commodities.  
* **AGI hype devalues human labour:** Regardless of whether AI will be able to replace substantial labour, investors’ obsession with AI’s potential implicitly diminishes the bargaining power of labour today. 

## The Transformation

The shift from selective migration to people as an asset class emerged from a collision of contradictory pressures. While demographic decline in wealthy nations created economic demand for immigrants, climate impacts and conflict drove displacement at unprecedented scales. This occurred as nationalist movements gained power by explicitly rejecting humanitarian obligations toward migrants, while technology sector narratives framed human labour as an interim solution pending automation—creating the conditions for a new approach: treating human mobility as an asset management challenge rather than a rights-based or humanitarian issue.

The COVID pandemic normalised mobility restrictions and accelerated digitisation of border controls, creating infrastructure for tighter tracking and control of individuals. Beyond wealthy individuals gaining access to "golden visa" programs, changes to work patterns spurred an explosion of digital nomad schemes and new economic competition pushed countries to offer a widening array of preferential visa packages, expanding the foundation for multi-tier mobility systems.

The acceleration point came as nations began openly discussing population engineering as policy, rather than maintaining the pretence that migration was primarily about individual agency or humanitarian protection. This shift manifested through the proliferation of third-country processing centres, expansion of private detention facilities and explicit bilateral agreements managing population flows based on economic and cultural criteria.

Nations now explicitly frame people crossing borders as quantifiable assets (or liabilities) with assigned economic and cultural values, stratifying mobility through algorithmic scoring systems. While high-net-worth individuals encounter investment thresholds, manual labourers face increasingly insurmountable barriers. Climate displacement accelerates as protection frameworks collapse, creating conflicts over population movements that affect both cross-border and internal migration. This commodification extends beyond immigration control to "sovereign labour" policies, where nations restrict outward mobility of citizens with valuable skills, treating human intellectual capital as national property to be retained within borders—a trend pioneered by China and rapidly spreading across technology powers.

Regional responses reflect this asset-based approach: wealthy ageing nations (Japan, South Korea, parts of Europe) implement labour importation models that implement employer-tied visa systems that risk creating indentured servitude. Gulf states expand tiered citizenship hierarchies, as the US moves increasingly toward ethnic nationalism in its migration policies while maintaining economic exceptions for specific high-value sectors. China leverages population size while aggressively retaining talent, and both Africa and South Asia manage intra-continental migration pressures while developing formalised labour export schemes that further commodify human movement. These divergent regional approaches create a fragmented global mobility landscape where a person's value—and thus their freedom of movement—is increasingly determined by their national origin, skill category and cultural attributes rather than their rights as a human being.

Surveillance technologies enable unprecedented tracking based on constantly shifting definitions of human value, while bilateral agreements replace multilateral frameworks, treating populations as tradable commodities. The humanitarian facade has given way to explicit economic valuation and security calculations, with corporate entities profiting from both detention infrastructure and premium mobility services.

## Strategic Blind Spots

* **Failure of Humanitarian Systems:** Aid framework erosion leaves displaced populations without institutional advocates, while public willingness to accommodate migrants narrows toward specific categories with ethnically or class-specific narratives.   
* **Pervasive Detention-Surveillance Complex:** Border enforcement expands from physical boundaries to pervade entire national territories, transforming immigration control from a perimeter function to a ubiquitous surveillance system.   
* **Remittance Disruption Impacts:** Restrictions on labour migration severely reduce critical financial flows to developing economies, destabilising households dependent on overseas workers and undermining healthcare, education and housing investments in sender communities.  
* **Skill Corridor Lock-in:** Critical expertise becomes trapped within alliance structures, creating a new kind of brain drain, when cross-system collaboration is needed, especially in emergency response, scientific research and global health.  
* **Cultural Algorithm Biases:** Automated cultural scoring systems embed historical prejudices while appearing objective, particularly penalising applicants from regions with colonial histories or current geopolitical tensions.  
* **Alternative Migration Networks**: Underground infrastructure enabling movement outside official channels becomes more sophisticated and widespread, leveraging cryptocurrency, encrypted communication and corrupt official connections.  
* **Automation Narrative Distortion**: AI replacement discourse depresses labour's bargaining power today regardless of whether automation materialises, while obscuring continued structural dependency on migrant workers in sectors resistant to automation.

## Global System Implications

* **Rights Frameworks Collapse:** Beyond mere erosion, entire international protection systems become ceremonial as nation-states explicitly reject previous humanitarian obligations in favour of sovereign control narratives.  
* **Population Trading Becomes Normalised:** Human population groups are explicitly discussed as strategic assets in diplomatic negotiations, with nations bargaining over demographic segments in public policy debates.  
* **The Essential Worker Contradiction:** Wealthy nations facing demographic decline depend on immigrant labour for care, agriculture and manufacturing. Yet restrictive policies exclude precisely these workers, while technology advocates promote automation narratives that may never arrive.  
* **Mobility Apartheid Emerges:** Society stratifies into mobility castes with fundamentally different legal realities, creating an unprecedented global class division based on freedom of movement rather than wealth.  
* **Shadow Migration Systems Institutionalise:** What were once informal "underground" networks evolve into sophisticated parallel systems with their own governance structures, creating competitive alternatives to state-controlled channels.

## Strategic Landscape

### Architecting

* States developing migration policies seen internationally as templates, such as Denmark’s hard-line migration rules, Australia’s points-based entry, Estonia’s e-visa, or Britain expanding the concept of third-county deportation  
* Border technology companies developing AI-driven migrant scoring algorithms that determine mobility access based on predictive risk factors  
* Government ministries creating tiered mobility systems that stratify migration rights based on economic value and security assessments  
* Private detention contractors building infrastructure for containment as migration increasingly faces criminalisation across multiple jurisdictions  
* Tech firms creating digital identity verification systems for border control that establish persistent surveillance capabilities beyond physical checkpoints  
* AI advocates promoting replacement narratives that reinforce the treatment of labour as fungible input

### Resisting

* Humanitarian organisations facing institutional collapse as frameworks that previously protected their operations continue to erode  
* Migrant rights advocacy networks documenting abuses in detention systems while facing increased criminalisation of their monitoring activities  
* Origin countries losing critical remittance flows due to mobility restrictions that block traditional migration corridors for low-skilled workers  
* Civil society organisations preserving space for humanitarian principles through strategic litigation and multilateral advocacy campaigns  
* Legal advocates challenging the privatisation of migration control through constitutional courts and regional human rights mechanisms  
* Self-designated sanctuary jurisdictions seeking to protect migrants from detention and/or deportation

### Exploiting

* Corporations profiting from both detention systems and premium mobility services as migration governance becomes increasingly marketised  
* Nations with strategic labour surpluses negotiating favourable bilateral agreements that secure preferred migration channels for their citizens  
* Smuggling networks adapting to offer alternative migration pathways as official routes become inaccessible to most populations  
* Wealthy individuals accessing premium mobility services and multiple citizenship options that insulate them from migration restrictions  
* Technology companies selling surveillance and scoring systems to governments eager to demonstrate control over population movements

### Avoiding

* Shadow economy employers operating outside formal labour regulations to maintain access to undocumented workers despite increased enforcement  
* Digital nomads leveraging remote work to minimise visa dependencies while accessing mobility privileges unavailable to traditional migrants  
* Undocumented communities developing parallel support systems that provide essential services without triggering detection by authorities  
* Underground networks creating alternative documentation and movement channels that circumvent official border control infrastructure  
* Informal remittance systems operating outside regulated banking to maintain financial flows between migrants and families, despite restrictions

### Shaped

* Climate-displaced populations without recognition under existing frameworks facing protection gaps as their movements are classified as voluntary  
* Low-income migrants providing "essential" labour without mobility privileges, experiencing increased exploitation as their bargaining power diminishes  
* Families separated by increasingly restrictive family reunification policies, enduring prolonged separation without legal pathways to reunite  
* Refugees trapped in expanding third-country detention networks facing indefinite containment with diminished access to asylum determination  
* Essential workers deemed "low-value" despite economic necessity finding exclusion from mobility pathways despite labour market demands  
* Migrants scored negatively by algorithmic cultural assessment systems, experiencing automated rejection without meaningful appeal mechanisms

## Scenarios

### Stratified Migration Markets

Population management becomes normalised as nations engage in more explicit demographic engineering through targeted migration policies. A functional market in human capital emerges, with nations competing for skilled migrants while negotiating labor mobility agreements with specific sending countries. Advanced predictive analytics enable governments to forecast demographic needs decades ahead, with migration policies adjusted quarterly based on economic projections and cultural integration metrics. Mobility systems create differentiated access based on economic value and country of origin, with streamlined processes for investors and skilled workers, while others face mounting barriers. 

Corporate management of migration processing expands, blurring public and private roles in determining who can move where. Private firms develop sophisticated "migrant yield forecasting" services that help nations maximise returns on their population investments. Nations increasingly frame migration policy around demographic objectives rather than individual rights or humanitarian protection, with bilateral agreements resembling asset transfer protocols more than human mobility frameworks.

**Adaptive Strategies:**

* **Organisations:** Develop ethical migration sponsorship models that value migrants as whole persons rather than economic inputs, while creating industry standards for responsible recruitment.  
* **Communities:** Build "solidarity city" networks connecting urban areas across borders with shared standards and support systems that operate alongside official frameworks.  
* **Individuals:** Cultivate "code-switching" abilities to navigate between official and alternative systems while supporting counter-networks that protect vulnerable migrants.  
* **Advocates:** Focus on portable rights frameworks rather than border politics, creating practical alternatives that demonstrate viable models for more humane mobility systems.

### Migration Deadlock

Persistent tension emerges between labour market needs and political resistance to immigration. Nations implement inconsistent policies that simultaneously recruit certain migrants while restricting others, creating policy whiplash with each administration change. Demographic pressures from ageing populations create desperate labour shortages in essential sectors, while xenophobic backlash prevents coherent solutions. The "essential worker contradiction" becomes permanent—societies structurally depend on immigrant labour, they simultaneously demonise and restrict. 

Regional migration approaches diverge, with some areas pursuing economic integration while others prioritise cultural preservation. Cross-border metropolitan regions develop pragmatic labour arrangements, while rural areas implement restrictive measures, creating internal mobility contradictions within nations. Underground movement networks adapt alongside increasingly sophisticated enforcement, creating parallel systems that undermine official channels. Informal economies absorb undocumented workers despite enforcement campaigns, maintaining essential functions through shadow arrangements. Civil society fragments between pro-migrant and enforcement-focused advocacy, preventing consensus on workable solutions.

**Adaptive Strategies:**

* **Organisations:** Create "mobility infrastructure" that functions despite policy oscillation, focusing on practical support systems rather than depending on political resolution.  
* **Communities:** Implement local integration frameworks that operate regardless of national policy shifts, building resilience against electoral volatility.  
* **Individuals:** Develop skills in sectors with critical labour shortages to maximise negotiating power and mobility options within contradictory systems.  
* **Advocates:** Shift from rights-based arguments to highlighting the "essential worker contradiction" through economic data and compelling narratives.

### Migration Chaos with Emergent Responses

Climate displacement and resource conflicts overwhelm both official migration systems and alternative networks. Successive climate disasters displace tens of millions globally, with another hundred million in climate-vulnerable zones seeking proactive relocation. Border violence escalates as militarised enforcement confronts desperate movement. Automated interdiction systems operate in maritime zones while militias patrol land borders, creating zones of recurring humanitarian emergencies. Digital identity systems fail under deliberate attacks, creating identification crises for both citizens and migrants. Detention facilities become sites of humanitarian disaster and conflict, with a global archipelago of for-profit containment facilities operating with minimal oversight.

Parallel governance structures emerge not as principled alternatives but as exploitative shadow systems—smuggling networks transform into quasi-states controlling territory, private security firms operate autonomous border zones and labour brokers create modern indentured servitude. The privatisation of migration management accelerates in unexpected directions, combining elements of security contracting and humanitarian response. Government capacity deteriorates as both migration management and counter-systems fragment into localised, incompatible domains.

The distinction between regular and irregular migration collapses entirely. Mobility becomes determined by immediate power dynamics rather than law or rights frameworks. Communities dependent on migrant labour face economic collapse, while sending communities lose vital remittances. Human mobility continues, but through increasingly dangerous and exploitative channels that neither states nor civil society can effectively govern.

**Adaptive Strategies:**

* **Organisations:** Build crisis response systems through direct partnerships with affected communities, creating support networks that function without failing international frameworks.  
* **Communities:** Establish "climate mobility corridors" that connect impacted regions to areas with capacity and need through community-to-community agreements that bypass national systems.  
* **Individuals:** Build social networks and develop skills valued across different governance systems, rather than relying on failing legal protections.  
* **Advocates:** Promote bioregional governance models based on ecosystem capacity rather than political boundaries, demonstrating practical alternatives through local implementation.

## Current Signals

**Signal 1: Tiered Mobility and Strategic Skills Management**

Nations are creating formal mobility hierarchies with special pathways for strategically valuable skills while erecting barriers for others. These systems explicitly prioritise economic value and security considerations over humanitarian concerns.

**Recent Examples:**

* The EU's Digital Travel Information System creates pre-screening barriers based on nationality before travellers reach physical borders. [https://www.statewatch.org/news/2024/january/risk-screening-and-watchlists-europol-and-frontex-reports-on-development-of-the-permission-to-travel-system/](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2024/january/risk-screening-and-watchlists-europol-and-frontex-reports-on-development-of-the-permission-to-travel-system/)  
* UAE's Golden Visa program has boomed, almost doubling in grants from 2021 to 2022\. [https://www.ft.com/content/120e6bc7-a90b-4e86-9d56-1d06519ad17c](https://www.ft.com/content/120e6bc7-a90b-4e86-9d56-1d06519ad17c)  
* The US restricts Chinese STEM students in sensitive fields while fast-tracking visas for semiconductor and AI talent.

* The EU Blue Card system targets specific professional categories for preferential treatment, creating an explicit desirability hierarchy. [https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/migration-and-asylum/legal-migration-and-resettlement/work/eu-blue-card-attracting-highly-qualified-talent-eu\_en](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/migration-and-asylum/legal-migration-and-resettlement/work/eu-blue-card-attracting-highly-qualified-talent-eu_en)

**Signal 2: Migration Management Privatisation**

Migration control is rapidly shifting from a core government function to a corporate service. This privatisation creates powerful economic incentives to expand control infrastructure while reducing transparency and accountability.

**Recent Examples:**

* Private prison companies report record profits from migration management contracts, demonstrating economic incentives for detention expansion. [https://abcnews.go.com/US/top-private-prison-companies-profits-amid-administrations-immigration/story?id=124591009](https://abcnews.go.com/US/top-private-prison-companies-profits-amid-administrations-immigration/story?id=124591009)  
* Data analytics giant Palantir has expanded its ICE case management system, offering tools that greatly expand the immigration tracking capabilities of the agency. [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/22/ice-palantir-data](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/sep/22/ice-palantir-data)  
* After the UK's deal to pay Rwanda to accept deportees failed, the US has made similar payment-for-deportee arrangements with more than half a dozen countries. [https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/08/trump-migrant-deportation-countries-00336663](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/08/trump-migrant-deportation-countries-00336663)  
* Tech companies have secured billions in contracts for migrant processing technology, creating a lucrative market in mobility surveillance systems. [https://prismreports.org/2024/01/09/surveillance-capitalism-taken-over-immigration-enforcement/](https://prismreports.org/2024/01/09/surveillance-capitalism-taken-over-immigration-enforcement/)

**Signal 3: Labour Migration Commodification**

Nations are explicitly treating migrant workers as economic inputs rather than individuals, creating policies for specific labour categories while restricting others. These systems use scoring algorithms to determine which workers provide sufficient value to justify mobility rights.

**Recent Examples:**

* Japan has created sector-specific visas for "designated skilled workers" that tie migrants to particular industries based on labour shortages. [https://japan-forward.com/immigration-in-japan-accepting-foreigners-to-secure-a-workforce/](https://japan-forward.com/immigration-in-japan-accepting-foreigners-to-secure-a-workforce/)  
* Australia's Pacific Labour Mobility scheme restricts worker rights, creating a class of temporary labourers with limited pathways to permanent residence. [https://www.aph.gov.au/About\_Parliament/Parliamentary\_departments/Parliamentary\_Library/Research/Quick\_Guides/2023-24/PALMscheme](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_departments/Parliamentary_Library/Research/Quick_Guides/2023-24/PALMscheme)  
* EU Talent Partnerships with North African countries explicitly frame migration as a resource to be "managed" between countries, with minimal attention to migrant agency. [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip\_22\_7540](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7540)

**Signal 4: Humanitarian Containment Infrastructure**

Detention and deportation have replaced resettlement as the dominant response to displacement. Nations are investing heavily in facilities and technologies designed to prevent arrival and contain migrants outside normal legal frameworks.

**Recent Examples:**

* The US Department of Homeland Security has contracted to build a network of migrant detention centres nationwide, with an overall budget of $45 billion over four years. [https://english.elpais.com/usa/2025-10-28/trump-administration-turns-to-the-navy-to-build-new-migrant-detention-centers.html](https://english.elpais.com/usa/2025-10-28/trump-administration-turns-to-the-navy-to-build-new-migrant-detention-centers.html)  
* The EU-Tunisia deal funds migrant detention in Tunisia, with €105 million out €1 billion of overall aid dedicated to that project, outsourcing European border control beyond EU legal protections. [https://eu-tunisia.euobserver.com/](https://eu-tunisia.euobserver.com/)  
* Greece has established closed, controlled access centres that severely restrict asylum seeker movement, normalising long-term detention as standard practice. [https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/greece-impact-living-limbo-asylum-seekers-mental-health](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/greece-impact-living-limbo-asylum-seekers-mental-health)

**Boundaries**: This forecast examines the global shift from selectively discriminatory migration regimes to explicit human asset classification systems. It focuses on how states and private entities engineer tiered mobility rights based on economic and technocratic valuation rather than humanitarian principles and recognition of human agency. Key enablers include digital identity technologies, demographic pressures, privatised border control, and alliance-based skill corridors.
