## Abstract

Money is mutating—its three functions are unbundling into a profusion of rarely interoperable *money things*, of which the dollar is only one of many—requiring organisations to use and support a multiplicity of financial systems that will continually combine, fork and fail.

## Key Domains

Financial Architecture, Digital Information Ecosystems, Trade Systems, Global Supply Chains

## Bottom Line

The dollar doesn't collapse—money itself fragments. Its three functions—store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account—are unbundling across systems that rarely interoperate: gold tokens, bilateral swaps, stablecoins, tokenised energy, warehouse receipts. Corridor sufficiency replaces universal reach when systems only need to work where you operate. Within five years, diversified but inefficient financial arrangements shift from niche to default. The question is no longer "What currency do I hold?" but "What money things perform the functions I need and who controls them?" Organisations operating across borders must choose which systems to commit to, knowing they can combine, fork and fail unpredictably. Strategic choices will reflect operational geography and alignment—not the financial optimisation logic of the past.

## Old Assumptions

* **The US Dollar Serves All Three Money Functions:** The US dollar bundles all three money functions. Half the world's financial transactions flow through USD-denominated networks or US-controlled entities.  
* **Efficiency Considerations Dominate:** Only the paranoid or oversophisticated engage in serious financial diversification. Normal actors use the USD because their counterparties can be relied upon to use it too.  
* **Only Sovereigns Build at Scale:** Sovereign nations issue fiat currencies, payment systems require state backing and monetary authority flows from political authority. Non-state financial systems are marginal—interesting experiments, not serious infrastructure operating at scale.   
* **Financial Infrastructure Is Neutral:** Payment rails and protocols are plumbing, apolitical and governed by efficiency considerations.   
* **Dollar Reliability Is a Policy Choice:** The dollar system's reliability depends on and can be restored through policy changes or new leadership.   
* **Dematerialisation Is Desirable:** The centuries-long movement from  precious metals, to paper, to digital ledgers represents progress because increasing dematerialisation enables increasing efficiency. Physical reserves of material assets are for an earlier, cruder era of international finance. 

## Emerging Norms

* **Functional Unbundling:** Financial systems built to reduce vulnerability to weaponised infrastructure cannot be integrated with that infrastructure without recreating the vulnerability.  
* **Infrastructure Weaponisation:** The more the US uses dollar infrastructure for geopolitics, the faster countries will build alternatives.  
* **Experimentation Drives Transformation:** The most significant changes emerge from uncoordinated experimentation by small players trying to do what money does without using traditional money.   
* **Local Adequacy Is More Important than Universal Reach:** Financial systems only need to function where you actually operate. The driving consideration is local adequacy, not global efficiency.  
* **Materiality as a Substitute for Trust:** The dematerialised system requires trust in institutions maintaining the abstraction. When those institutions demonstrate they can freeze, seize, or exclude dematerialised assets at will, tangibility becomes valuable again.

## The Transformation

We’re in the middle of a transformation of financial systems from being stable, globalised and currency-dominated to being continually evolving, local/regional and supported by a highly-diverse system of imperfectly interoperable money things. Four forces are driving the unbundling of money's functions—store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account—which fiat currencies have bundled together for eight decades, plus the proliferation of new alternatives. The US is weaponising the infrastructure it controls with sanctioned states building alternatives for survival, emerging powers building for influence and edge actors building for profit or autonomy. Each force acts independently while together they accelerate fragmentation faster than any one state could alone.

The infrastructure that spread the 2008 crisis proved equally effective at spreading coercion. For example, Iran cut from SWIFT in 2012, Russia in 2022, Afghanistan's reserves have been frozen. Countries now understood the rails could be switched off by the states controlling them.

When bank accounts are forcibly closed and transactions suddenly fail, people resort to alternatives or build new ones. Countries start negotiating bilateral currency swaps. China's QR-code payment backbone created transaction ecosystems independent of dollar rails and the digital yuan extends this logic. 137 countries are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as sovereign alternatives to dollar infrastructure.

Most alternatives fail. Most cryptocurrencies collapse. Most CBDCs remain stalled pilots. Most bilateral swap arrangements see little actual use. Currency systems are extraordinarily sticky—they change slowly, then suddenly. We're still in the slow part. But the direction is visible: de-dollarisation is less a policy choice than a physical drift—money moving back toward the things it must eventually buy.

Central banks are now buying gold at levels not seen since Bretton Woods and generally moving into assets with much lower counterparty uncertainty. Beyond gold, bilateral barter—e.g. China-Iran oil-for-infrastructure arrangements, Russia-India rupee-ruble workarounds—physical stockpiling in strategic reserves of everything from rare earths to GPUs and trading via shadow networks of sanctioned commodities, technologies, warehouse receipts, or semi-finished goods such as chips, car parts. The return to materiality isn't regression, it's instead a rational response to demonstrated institutional unreliability. What’s new is that many of these material assets are being tokenised—gold tokens, ledgered warehouse receipts—so they can interoperate with emerging digital infrastructure.

Tokenising material assets functions as the bridge between new modalities and traditional asset types. And that’s making it easier for traditional finance to adopt these new modalities. Tokenised US treasuries and bonds exceed $9 billion on-chain across BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, Circle's USYC and others, wrapping conventional assets in alternative infrastructure. Corporations and sovereigns now hold Bitcoin as treasury reserve, treating it as a store of value outside banking systems they're increasingly willing to hedge against.

Infrastructure capacity, compute access, energy installations and supplier relationships can take on money functions in specific contexts. GPU access functions as a medium of exchange where chips are scarce—one VC's value proposition is that it owns a training cluster portfolio companies can access. Currency becomes optional.

The shift is hard to detect in conventional financial surveillance systems because it routes around currency transactions rather than explicitly replacing them, or services new ecosystems which were not built on currency. The driving forces for the shift are geopolitical, weaponisation through sanctions, tariffs, or exclusions. Exposure to a fiat currency is a channel for inadvertently importing the problems that fiat’s sovereign issuer creates. What makes this different from previous dollar anxiety is that alternatives now exist.

What's emerging is not a new monolithic global financial system, but a proliferation of partial local systems, each performing some money functions in some contexts for some actors. The dollar and other major fiat currencies won’t disappear. They’ll just become one option among many money things—still powerful, but no longer default and universal. 

The conceptualisation and operationalisation of finance will become more complex and unstable. Moving resources where they're needed—funding, equipment, supplies, expertise and operational capacity—will require fluency across incompatible systems. The same organisation may need dollars for one partner, stablecoins for another and physical goods for a third, so these systems won’t be stable, predictable and perfectly interoperable. In the best case scenario, these diverse systems of money things will be highly frictional but very adaptable to perturbation, they will combine, fork, fail and route around each other in real time.

## Strategic Blind Spots

* **Functional Unbundling Is the Story:** Trying to pick which fiat wins is the wrong question when money's functions are unbundling across value forms that aren't currencies at all.   
* **Assuming Adequate Time to Adapt:** Large institutions and rich countries optimise the financial infrastructures they use based on assumptions of stability that are increasingly illusory.  
* **Missing Breakthrough Patterns:** Alternative value forms like cryptocurrencies and blockchain systems keep failing, making it easy to dismiss them. Though early phases of eventually transformational new technologies and paradigms never look promising.  
* **Refusing to Trade Efficiency for Resilience:** Efficiency dominates only when the efficient system can be trusted not to be weaponised against you.

## Global System Implications

* **Operational Disruption:** Organisations and countries dependent on dollar infrastructure without alternatives face serious disruption when those channels close—or are closed to them.  
* **Early Infrastructure-Builders Gain Influence:** Those with ready alternatives won’t need coercion to be influential. China has done this in East and Southeast Asia with its Cross-Border Interbank Payment System and bilateral swap arrangements.  
* **Geography Dominates Financial Destiny:** Actors close to major powers will be irresistibly drawn into their money things. This will matter most for countries close to the US and China.  
* **Knowledge Gaps Are Expensive:** Expertise for operating across fragmented systems represents fundamentally different knowledge than traditional treasury management.   
* **Shaping Financial Architecture:** Countries like South Korea, Türkiye, Brazil, Australia and Indonesia could become active designers of alternatives, not just passive recipients of financial fragmentation.

## AREAS Strategic landscape

### Architecting

* China deploying digital yuan, Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, bilateral currency swaps, QR code payment systems across East and Southeast Asia  
* BRICS establishing BRICS Pay and BRICS Bridge with 159 countries having expressed interest in collaboration  
* India scaling UPI internationally; Gulf states building African infrastructure as non-dollar stores of value  
* Regional powers offering neighbours dollar alternatives gain structural influence

### Resisting

* US maintaining dollar dominance whilst weaponising infrastructure  
* Large institutions struggling to justify alternative investments when current systems work  
* EU maintaining dollar reserves whilst building alternatives—uncomfortable middle ground  
* Traditional banks resisting alternative integration  
* International financial regulators monitoring financial flows and enforcing sanctions  
* EU accelerating digital euro development as defensive response to US stablecoin push

### Exploiting

* Margin countries (Middle East, North Africa, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe) operating in both USD and renminbi spheres, gaining leverage from choice  
* Singapore and UAE leveraging regulatory arbitrage  
* Multi-currency platforms (Wise, Airwallex) and payment technology providers capitalising on fragmentation  
* Financial institutions earning fees from dual-system complexity  
* Shadow market operators enabling trade in sanctioned goods  
* Entrepreneurs creating derivatives of emerging value forms

### Avoiding

* Cryptocurrency and blockchain developers building decentralised alternatives  
* Creator economy participants building token-based micro-economies bypassing currency entirely  
* Infrastructure barter networks, community time banking systems  
* Individuals experimenting with stores of value outside traditional banking  
* Civil society groups using shadow financial channels to avoid attention and control 

### Shaped

* Canada and Latin America by USD, Russia, East and Southeast Asia (trade integration), Africa (infrastructure debt) by renminbi   
* Small and Mid-sized Businesses (SMBs) unable to receive international payments  
* Exporters losing market access when correspondent banking exits, nonprofits unable to transfer funds  
* Cross-border families using remittances as economic lifelines

## Scenario Pathways

### Parallel Payment Infrastructure

Financial infrastructure fragments but remains functional. Different organisations develop capabilities across correspondent banking, central bank digital currency platforms, stablecoin networks and mobile money—with technology providers building integration layers that route payments through whatever system offers the best combination of speed, cost and reliability for specific corridors.

Regional systems mature into robust alternatives. India's UPI expands across South and Southeast Asia, BRICS settlement systems scale to dozens of countries processing trillions, stablecoin infrastructure reaches $2 trillion with regulatory frameworks that finally enable institutional adoption. Regional digital currencies emerge in West Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. Countries sitting between dollar and renminbi spheres operate in both systems—expensively, but gaining leverage from having optionality. Market specialists enable exchange of different value forms across often incompatible infrastructure, with minimal friction.

The ability to code-switch between systems becomes a standard organisational capability. Treasury teams become fluent in navigating multiple frameworks, service providers offer specialised knowledge in specific corridors and payment failures become manageable complications rather than existential crises. The dollar remains important but loses its universality, it continues as the primary reserve currency and dominant trade settlement mechanism, but no longer provides exclusive access to international commerce.

* **Organisations:** Develop modular treasury structures with teams specialising in navigating different money things, their associated infrastructures, and their incompletely compatible compliance frameworks.   
* **Communities:** Create shared knowledge networks mapping which money things and infrastructures work in specific corridors. Pool resources for collective relationships with fintech providers.   
* **Individuals:** Develop multi-system financial literacy understanding when to use different money things. Maintain backup channels for critical transactions.   
* **Advocates:** Focus on maintaining operational continuity across fragmented systems rather than opposing fragmentation itself. Build coalitions around specific payment corridors that unite actors despite different strategic positions on the underlying geopolitical tensions.

### Payment System Deadlock

Fragmentation creates persistent operational challenges that never quite resolve. Traditional dollar banking remains necessary for major transactions and institutional legitimacy but becomes increasingly unreliable for many corridors as banks continue their de-risking. Alternative systems scale without achieving full maturity—central bank digital currencies get stuck in extended pilots, stablecoins face regulatory uncertainty and mobile money lacks international integration.

Payment corridors open and close unpredictably based on geopolitics, regulatory changes and individual banking decisions. Organisations maintain expensive multi-system capabilities, but still experience frequent failures. Compliance costs escalate as organisations must navigate multiple incomplete frameworks without achieving operational efficiency. The built infrastructure persists even when relations improve. China's systems, bilateral swaps and regional payment networks remain functional but fragmented.

The “banking relationship contradiction” becomes a permanent feature of the landscape. Organisations need alternatives for certain corridors but still require traditional banking relationships for institutional legitimacy. Staff spend substantial time troubleshooting payment failures, explaining delays to partners, improvising workarounds. Technology integration remains incomplete, requiring manual intervention. Reconciliation becomes increasingly complex as transactions move through different rails with different reporting standards.

* **Organisations:** Build payment flexibility into all cross-border agreements, explicitly acknowledging transfer mechanisms may change unpredictably. Budget for payment redundancy as a permanent cost rather than temporary expense.  
* **Communities:** Develop shared and regularly updated systems for tracking which financial systems work where (including shutdowns and other denials of service).   
* **Individuals:** Accept higher transaction costs and longer delays as permanent features of the landscape. Maintain emergency reserves capable of absorbing payment interruptions.   
* **Advocates:** Push for basic corridor functionality and transparency about system reliability, rather than comprehensive reform. Build coalitions around specific operational needs that unite actors despite different strategic positions on broader policy questions.

### Decentralised Disruption

A technological breakthrough enables peer-to-peer transactions at and across different units of analysis—person to company, nation to person, company to multilateral organisation—that are fast, cheap and reliable without requiring any centralised infrastructure. Distributed systems outcompete sovereign currencies without needing sovereignty themselves. This isn't about cryptocurrencies replacing fiat currencies directly, rather it is about using money things for new purposes that never used currency in the first place.

Stores of value become tokens tied to real assets or future productivity. Media of exchange become direct swaps without any intermediary currency. Units of account become project-specific or community-specific. Creator coins and micro-economies that were small experiments scale rapidly. Traditional financial institutions discover their infrastructure has become obsolete—not just less efficient but fundamentally unnecessary for most transactions.

Adoption curves prove extraordinarily steep once the systems work properly; we see a ChatGPT moment for finance. Sovereign currencies don't disappear, but lose relevance for most cross-border activity. Organisations discover that decentralised systems eliminate correspondent banking entirely, compliance frameworks become peer-to-peer reputation systems, and transaction costs drop by orders of magnitude.

* **Organisations:** Build experimental capacity testing decentralised systems for non-critical transactions whilst maintaining traditional banking for institutional legitimacy. Create flexible infrastructure that can rapidly scale successful experiments.  
* **Communities:** Pool resources for collective experimentation with decentralised payment systems. Share real-time information about which systems work reliably versus which remain experimental.   
* **Individuals:** Develop technological literacy in decentralised transaction systems alongside use of traditional finance. Participate in creator economies and peer-to-peer networks to learn how these alternatives work before they become critical financial infrastructure.  
* **Advocates:** Focus on ensuring decentralised systems remain accessible to marginalised actors who currently face exclusion. Build coalitions around open protocols and interoperability standards.

**Boundaries:** This forecast examines the transformation of international financial infrastructure and transaction systems. Rather than focusing on currency competition, it analyses the disaggregation of money's three core functions (medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account), which have been bundled in the US dollar for eight decades. The analysis explores how this functional unbundling affects dollar-based infrastructure and examines emerging alternatives for each function, concluding with three scenarios for how international financial activity may evolve. It does not address macroeconomic impacts of dollar displacement, cryptocurrency as investment vehicle, domestic payment evolution, or monetary policy beyond alternative infrastructure development.
