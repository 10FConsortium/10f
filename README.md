# 10F Forecasts

## From One Game to Many Games

### What Is 10F?

Ten strategic forecasts mapping how unified global systems are fragmenting into multiple incompatible arrangements. We call this the shift from "one game to many games"—where organizations must now navigate competing rules, shifting alliances, and parallel systems that don't interoperate.

This is strategic intelligence for organizations making decisions in a world where the old playbook no longer applies.

### Who This Is For

Decision-makers navigating systemic uncertainty: NGO program officers, foundation strategists, government policy teams, corporate risk managers, and multilateral organizations operating across borders. Built for practitioners who need actionable intelligence, not academic theory.

## Key Finding

What we're witnessing isn't random chaos but systematic reorganization driven by strategic norm abandonment. When powerful actors defect from established rules—whether tariff frameworks, climate commitments, or information transparency—it signals that old constraints no longer bind. This triggers cascades of imitation that transform entire systems. Organizations assuming a return to normal will discover the ground has shifted beneath them.

## Analytical Framework

Each forecast is structured around a "From-To" paradigm shift—contrasting legacy assumptions against emerging realities. Analysis includes current signals and evidence, short scenarios exploring how transformations might unfold, strategic blind spots organizations typically miss, and recommended actions.

The [AREAS model](00A%20The%20AREAS%20Framework_%20A%20Guide%20to%20Strategic%20Positioning.md) maps who's Architecting, Resisting, Exploiting, Avoiding, or being Shaped by each shift—moving beyond static geopolitical categories toward dynamic positioning analysis.

## Origin and Process

**Self-organized. Open-access. Built for post-2025 disruption.**

Twenty-plus independent practitioners—no institutional sponsor, no client agenda—came together to produce the strategic foresight that traditional institutions aren't delivering. The consortium convened for an intensive two-day workshop in Singapore, followed by distributed drafting and editorial collaboration across six continents.
