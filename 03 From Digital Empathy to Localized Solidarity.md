# 03	From Digital Empathy to  	Localised Solidarity

> **Context:** This is one of the [10F forecasts](00%20Reading%20and%20Applying%20the%2010F%20Forecasts.md). See also: [Understanding the Transformation](00%20One%20Game%20to%20Many%20Games%5F%20%20Understanding%20the%20Transformation.md) and the [AREAS Framework](00A%20The%20AREAS%20Framework%5F%20A%20Guide%20to%20Strategic%20Positioning.md).

## Abstract 

Agreed social norms of global empathy shift away from care for universal causes, to solidarity reserved only for those in proximity, as defined by identity, geography or immediate networks. 

## Key Domains

Civil Society & Democratic Institutions, Global Health Infrastructure, Social Values & Identity Systems, Climate Mitigation & Adaptation, Migration & Population Movements

## Bottom Line

Digital platforms promised to scale empathy globally, but these "empathy engines" that were supposed to connect the world became economics-fuelled attention machines, which fractured it. The infrastructure for coordinated grassroots action—crowdfunding, volunteer coordination, collective organising—never scaled beyond identity-bounded networks. Organisations mobilising around global issues (climate mitigation, refugee support, anti-atrocity, pandemic cooperation) face systemic fatigue, as do domestic coalitions requiring solidarity across differences: universal programs, long-term infrastructure, or taxation. 

Empathy has a radius. Digital platforms promised to extend it globally. Instead, they contracted it to the people who look like you, live near you, or appear in your feed. The global village became gated communities. This care collapse has generated new organising logics: proximity-bounded frameworks like neighbourhood mutual aid, identity-based crowdfunding, participatory investing and hyperlocal governance now channel collective action more reliably than global platforms, but only within their defined boundaries. Local bonds strengthen during immediate crises while distant solidarity becomes an unsustainable luxury, undermining operations dependent on cross-community coalition building, international consensus, or mobilising resources for abstract future benefits. "Think globally, act locally" has been replaced with "Think locally, act privately."

## Old Assumptions

* **Think Globally, Act Digitally:** The Internet and digital channels scale individual caring communities from local to global.   
* **Digital Platforms as Empathy Engines:** Social media and digital channels convert visibility into caring, scaling individual concern from local to global through algorithmic connection.  
* **Exposure Generates Action:** Seeing distant suffering creates a social obligation to respond. Awareness translates to engagement and material support.  
* **Viral Solidarity Works:** Digital campaigns mobilise resources across distances. Hashtags, viral content and online organising successfully support global responses to crises.  
* **Connection Builds Trust:** More communication channels and information flows strengthen social bonds and shared understanding across differences.  
* **The Whole World Is Watching:** Journalism and social networks hold powerful people, organisations and corporations to account.   
* **Shame as a Force for Good:** Shame is a motivating force for high-profile individuals, corporations and governments to do the right thing  
* **Crises Generate Solidarity:** Disasters and examples of gross injustice create broad empathy mobilisation, regardless of proximity.

## Emerging Norms

* **Proximity Gates Access to Empathy**: Support requires verifiable closeness—geographic, network-based, or identity-aligned. Distance blocks solidarity, regardless of need, severity, or legitimacy of cause.  
* **Empathy as Performance**: Public expressions of care function primarily as tribal markers rather than mobilisation tools. Empathy signals in-group membership without generating material support.  
* **Exposure Without Obligation**: Awareness of distant crises creates no binding social pressure to respond. Being informed becomes optional content consumption rather than moral imperative.  
* **Viral Attention Fails to Convert:** Online visibility generates brief awareness spikes that rarely translate to sustained material support. Attention economies reward engagement over action, exhausting audiences without mobilising resources.  
* **Shame Mechanisms Fail**: Public criticism and reputational exposure no longer compel behavioural change. Organisations absorb negative attention as a manageable cost rather than forcing constraint.  
* **Contested Topics Signal Risk:** Discussing politics, foreign conflicts, or social movements becomes socially risky—read as divisive, naive, or potential entrapment. Neutral silence becomes the default public stance.  
* **Platforms as Decision Layers**: Hard allocation choices—who gets resources, attention, protection—migrate to systems that absorb responsibility without accountability. Algorithms, platforms, strongman figures and abstract forces ("the market," "karma") make decisions that individuals and institutions can no longer sustain making themselves.

## The Transformation

The early Internet promised a "global village" connecting distant cultures through peer-to-peer networks. Building on 24/7 satellite media, digital platforms would link a student in Santiago with a senior citizen in Saigon. Connection could generate social intimacy—visibility would scale empathy.

Social media platforms in the early 2000s amplified and capitalised on this promise, explicitly marketing missions to "connect the world" and "bring people together." They promised the technology would do the work: algorithmic feeds surfacing distant suffering, viral mechanics amplifying urgent needs, with network effects mobilising coordinated response. The Arab Spring tested this theory. Pro-democracy protests erupting across the Middle East and North Africa in late 2010 brought life-or-death struggles to millions of screens worldwide. Digital visibility generated tangible international support. 

Within five years, the promise fractured. The same many-to-many architecture that enabled connection became an attack surface. Algorithmic curation monetised attention by amplifying conflict over consensus. Coordinated harassment campaigns—from Gamergate through the 2014 Ukraine information warfare campaigns, to the 2016 US presidential campaign, Brexit and elections from Brazil to India, Bangladesh, Hungary, Zimbabwe and Thailand—demonstrated that digital channels could break trust faster than build it. What functioned as a global village in 2011 operated as a combat zone by 2016\. 

Algorithmic curation didn't scale solidarity—it sorted people into opposing camps, which power holders capitalised on. Disinformation, polarisation and algorithmic filtering broke empathy infrastructure in both digital and physical spaces. Social information pipelines and geographic distances collapsed—not into connection but into tribal retreat.The visibility that was supposed to generate caring instead generated fatigue, scepticism and withdrawal. 

Economic stratification visible outside one’s window, coupled with exogenous stresses and toxic narratives, such as perceived migration pressures, turned the global village inside out. Digital empathy engines became sorting mechanisms to reinforce in-group boundaries—sometimes geographic, often not. The universe has contracted to individual, family, community, or tribe.

The scale of withdrawal is measurable. Nearly four in ten people worldwide now actively avoid news—up ten percentage points since 2017\. In some countries, interest in news has halved within a decade. (Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2024\) Trust has followed: five of the ten largest global economies now rank among the least trusting nations, with government and media tied for lowest confidence. Six in ten survey respondents report moderate to high grievance toward institutions (Edelman Trust Barometer 2025). These aren't cultural preferences but structural shifts in how populations process distant information.

This attention collapse directly undermines the political economy of global solidarity. Donor governments rely on and respond to domestic publics, who no longer engage with distant crises. Development budgets are made politically indefensible when constituents withdraw from caring about problems beyond their proximity radius. The funding infrastructure built on assumed public support for universal causes faces systemic erosion.

International humanitarian funding fell by nearly $5 billion between 2024 and 2025—the largest single-year drop in a decade. The UN's 2025 global appeal was only 14% funded by August, with projections suggesting donor government funding could fall 34–45% from its 2023 peak. (UN OCHA; ALNAP Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2025). Social exhaustion, visibility-as-vulnerability and the tangibility of near needs make re-scaling empathy structurally difficult. Climate inaction, grinding atrocities in Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza, unchecked hate crimes and platform degradation compound the break. Each failure hardens the division.

The infrastructure that scaled empathy across distance won't be rebuilt in the near term. The economic and attentional costs now exceed what individuals and institutions can sustain. Global solidarity is structurally unviable because the systems supporting it have collapsed. 

As digital empathy pathways fail, communities build new solidarity and aid models within proximity constraints: Identity-based mutual aid networks, hyperlocal crowdfunding and participatory finance at community level, disaster response contained within visible boundaries, resource allocation defaulting to verifiable nearness. WhatsApp neighbourhood cells in India handle security and food delivery. Zakat networks in Indonesia and Malaysia route charity through mosque communities. Clan associations across East Asia fund education based on surname ties. Narco-welfare in Latin America provides services in specific territories. These systems—simpler, less vulnerable, proximity-gated—operate where digital infrastructure has failed. They work precisely because they're not trying to scale.

## Strategic Blind Spots

* **Generational Baseline Assumptions:** Appeals assume audiences remember when global causes generated action. Many younger people never experienced that system at all.   
* **Mistaking Exposure for Engagement:** Seeing a problem does not mean caring about it. Decision-makers haven't recognised the model is broken—visibility no longer prompts action and instead, creates fatigue.  
* **Treating Proximity as Preference:** The shift to local or in-group support—whether geographic neighbours or diaspora networks—gets read as narrowed self-interest  rather than economic reality. Maintaining attention and resources for problems removed from the in-group now costs more than most people and institutions can afford. 

## Global System Implications

* **Domestic Coalition Politics Narrow:** Building political majorities for policies requiring sacrifice—universal programs, progressive taxation, climate action, long-term infrastructure—depends on voters caring about others. Care collapse fragments electorates into interest blocs that struggle to sustain broad coalitions.  
* **Development Funding Restructures**: Traditional aid budgets face weakening domestic political support when voters default to proximity concerns, and politicians exploit this. Remaining flows reorganise around strategic interest, national security and other prioritised programs.  
* **Crisis Response Fractionalises**: Future emergencies meet regional responses before coordinated global ones. Health crises, natural disasters, refugee flows and economic shocks increasingly trigger bloc-based responses organised around existing alliances and affinities, rather than universal frameworks.  
* **Climate Cooperation Narrows**: Asking domestic populations to sacrifice for abstract future benefits to people elsewhere generates little political support. Visible local impacts drive action more reliably than global frameworks. International agreements persist as performative mechanisms, while actual resources flow to immediate, tangible resilience projects.

## AREAS Strategic Landscape

### Architecting

* Ethnonationalist parties and leaders are actively attempting to reshape the international normative consensus  
* Diaspora networks are managing informal financial flows   
* Participatory finance platforms are replacing institutional finance within identity-bounded communities  
* Mutual aid networks are coordinating local solidarity and response to crises  
* Social and clan associations are coordinating response through networks of relation  
* Alternative platform developers and digital commons projects are building decentralised coordination infrastructure  
* Community technology cooperatives are creating locally-controlled digital tools for mutual aid coordination, resource sharing, and collective decision-making

### Resisting

* Global coalitions are supporting cooperation around issues such as climate and health   
* Impartial news organisations and information providers are attempting to highlight crises and their causes  
* Communities with historical experience of targeted campaigns are building resilience infrastructure through necessity  
* Independent journalism cooperatives and fact-checking networks are maintaining verification infrastructure   
* Digital rights organisations and privacy advocates are building tools and literacy programs to help recognise and resist information manipulation  
* Open-source developers are creating platform alternatives that prioritise community control over engagement metrics

### Exploiting

* Platform companies are incentivising conflict through algorithms  
* Information warfare operators are coordinating disinformation campaigns and online attacks  
* Populist movements are channelling grievances and designating in-groups  
* Authoritarian actors are coordinating highly-visible atrocities    
* Ad-tech and data broker industries are monetising attention collapse and polarisation through micro-targeted manipulation at scale  
* Influencers in the manosphere are attacking solidarity as weakness, naivety or betrayal 

### Avoiding

* Socially exhausted populations are retreating from engagement at scale  
* Corporate actors are maintaining neutral positions to avoid attacks and negative attention  
* Groups not dependent on digital infrastructure are coordinating through other means  
* Communities are building coordination capacity through non-digital or minimal-digital infrastructure to avoid platform dependency and surveillance  
* Privacy-conscious populations are migrating to encrypted messaging and offline organising  
* Digital abstainers and platform refusers are opting out of online engagement entirely

### Shaped

* Crisis afflicted populations are caught in protracted conflict or have underaddressed needs  
* Refugees are under attack at home with hostile environments in potential destination countries  
* Humanitarian workers on the ground in crisis situations, are experiencing falling support  
* Vulnerable communities are facing near future hardship or conflict  
* Future generations are facing unaddressed challenges and crises that expand without widespread assistance  
* Platform-dependent organisers and advocacy groups are losing reach   
* Populations in the Global South are subject to Western platform policies and algorithmic choices  
* Young people with no experience of pre-algorithmic digital spaces are navigating solidarity through engagement-optimised interfaces as their baseline reality

## Short Scenario Pathways

### The Proximity Settlement

By 2035, the pretence is over. The humanitarian system has reorganised around who people actually help—their own. Diaspora networks, religious foundations and regional blocs handle crisis response. Everyone knows the rules now: resources flow through identity ties and need-based language survives only in diplomatic settings where no one expects it to mean anything.

Global platforms have fragmented into identity-bounded ecosystems—diaspora apps, community networks, regional social media—each with algorithmic curation that reinforces proximity. Verification of belonging gates access. Cross-network visibility has collapsed and a crisis outside your feeds doesn’t exist. 

The systems work, within their boundaries. Hometown associations in Mexico operate with locally deployable institutional capacity rivalling legacy INGOs. Zakat networks across Southeast Asia run sophisticated logistics. Somali clan remittance channels fund schools and clinics. Climate adaptation happens through regional compacts; global mitigation is discussed at summits and implemented nowhere.

The losers are obvious: populations without well-resourced diaspora networks, without religious community, or without regional bloc membership. They get charitable overflow when attention briefly lands on them—never rights-based response, never sustained support. 

**Adaptive Strategies:** 

* **Organisations**: Build operational partnerships with diaspora networks, religious charities and mutual aid systems—they have the trust infrastructure others lack.  
* **Communities**: Strengthen mutual aid now; it will be the primary support system and building it during a crisis is too late.  
* **Individuals**: Cultivate multiple network memberships; access to support depends on verifiable belonging and single-network dependence is fragile.  
* **Advocates**: Build bridges between excluded populations and protective structures rather than cataloging gaps for institutions that have stopped listening.

### The Exhausted Middle

By 2035, nothing has been resolved. Universal frameworks and proximity systems coexist poorly. A fragmented UN maintains reduced operations, perpetually underfunded, but never formally replaced, only patched up. Legacy INGOs survive in diminished form, cycling through crises that briefly trend before attention economics reassert the default. Platforms still optimise for engagement. Humanitarian organisations compete with AI-generated appeals indistinguishable from genuine ones. Donor fatigue compounds information pollution. The infrastructure that once made distant suffering visible now makes it unfindable.

Organisations can't commit to either logic. They oscillate between universal appeals and targeted campaigns, satisfying neither. Donor governments keep symbolic humanitarian budgets; real resources move through bilateral and diaspora channels. Crises cycle through brief visibility windows. Staff attrition increases. Populations in need experience fragmented support—sometimes resources arrive, often they don't, seldom sufficiently.

The gap between stated commitments and operational reality has widened, until official statements mean nothing. Climate agreements get signed and largely ignored. The system lurches between crisis-driven mobilisation and baseline neglect, persisting in permanent triage mode.

**Adaptive Strategies:** 

* **Organisations**: Build reserves during attention surges, cut fast when they fade; the funding environment rewards flexibility.   
* **Communities**: Develop internal triage protocols that enable making allocation decisions that external systems won't make for you.  
* **Individuals**: Maintain connections to both universal and proximity support systems without depending on either, as neither work reliably.  
* **Advocates**: Exploit attention windows aggressively; sustained campaigns won't work, so maximise impact during brief openings.

### The Caring Radius Contracts

By 2035, the remaining humanitarian response infrastructure has failed—starved and undersupported. The UN system operates as a coordination body without operational capacity. Legacy INGOs have either closed, merged, or redirected toward less challenging objectives. Unfortunately, the collapse doesn't stop at the international level—even support for near crises contracts under compounding pressures. 

Economic stress, climate displacement and political fragmentation shrink the radius of care even within identity networks. Mutual aid groups that grew in the later 2020s exhaust their volunteer base and funding sources. Remittances decline under economic stress. Religious charitable networks prioritise core members as resources tighten. Community platforms that coordinated mutual aid have been abandoned or captured by bad actors. WhatsApp groups still exist but trust has eroded. Digital coordination capacity has atrophied alongside institutional capacity.

Empathy becomes transactional at every level—extended only where immediate reciprocity is visible. The neighbourhood WhatsApp group that once coordinated food delivery now screens who qualifies as a real neighbour. Populations facing crises find neither international response nor functional local networks. Mobilisation is a very heavy lift for most organisations seeking to assist those in need. The infrastructure for caring about problems beyond one's household has broken down entirely without strong traditional connections or direct self-interest. The process is slow, banal and largely invisible to those inside it.

**Adaptive Strategies:** 

* **Organisations:** Convert institutional knowledge into transferable resources—training, protocols, documentation—that communities can use independently.  
* **Communities:** Formalising mutual aid at the smallest viable scale before crisis forces improvisation is essential, assuming that little assistance will arrive from further afield.  
* **Individuals:** Build genuine reciprocal relationships with neighbours now. These are people who would actually help each other when systems fail.  
* **Advocates:** Help communities build governance capacity for resource decisions that external systems used to handle.

## Current Signals

**Signal 1: Attention Infrastructure Breakdown**: 

**Recent Examples:**

News avoidance and institutional distrust have reached record levels globally, breaking the transmission mechanisms that once converted distant visibility into local action.

* 39% of people worldwide now sometimes or often avoid news, up from 29% in 2017\. [https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2024](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2024)  
* Five of the ten largest global economies rank among the least trusting nations: [https://www.edelman.com/trust/2025/trust-barometer](https://www.edelman.com/trust/2025/trust-barometer)  
* Facebook declined 10 points for weekly news use globally as platforms optimise for engagement over solidarity. Users are migrating to private messaging apps. [https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2024](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2024)

**Signal 2: Civic Infrastructure Hollowing:** 

Formal volunteering, group membership and civic participation are declining across demographic groups, with steeper drops among economically stressed communities worldwide.

**Recent Examples:**

* US civic group membership halved in a generation. [https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/disconnected-the-growing-class-divide-in-american-civic-life/](https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/disconnected-the-growing-class-divide-in-american-civic-life/)  
* European institutional trust erodes. [https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/en/blog/2024/trust-crisis-europes-social-contract-under-threat](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/en/blog/2024/trust-crisis-europes-social-contract-under-threat)  
* Since 2010, key indicators of social capital have shown little or no progress across OECD countries. [https://oecdcogito.blog/2024/12/18/can-social-capital-save-places/](https://oecdcogito.blog/2024/12/18/can-social-capital-save-places/)

**Signal 3: Humanitarian Funding Pulling Back:** 

International humanitarian assistance fell by nearly $5 billion in 2024—the largest single-year drop ever recorded. The disparity across crises reveals proximity logic in action: resources flow toward perceived in-groups, regardless of need severity.

**Recent Examples:**

* Ukraine's 2022 UN appeal was over 87% funded. Sudan—now the world's largest displacement crisis with up to 12 million people—reached only 57% for 2022, Yemen, 54%. [https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news-feature/2022/07/07/Ukraine-aid-Russia-invasion-funding-donors](https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news-feature/2022/07/07/Ukraine-aid-Russia-invasion-funding-donors)  
* Syria's 2025 humanitarian response is 14% funded, with projected staffing cuts of 40% across organisations. [https://unric.org/en/humanitarian-aid-the-most-vulnerable-already-severely-impacted-by-budget-cuts/](https://unric.org/en/humanitarian-aid-the-most-vulnerable-already-severely-impacted-by-budget-cuts/)

**Signal 4: Identity-Bounded Flows Replace Universal Frameworks:** 

Remittances and diaspora networks now move more resources than official development systems, routing support through verifiable identity connections rather than need-based allocation.

**Recent Examples:**

* Remittances to low- and middle-income countries reached $685 billion in 2024—larger than foreign direct investment and official development assistance combined. [https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/peoplemove/in-2024--remittance-flows-to-low--and-middle-income-countries-ar](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/peoplemove/in-2024--remittance-flows-to-low--and-middle-income-countries-ar)  
* Small economies now depend on diaspora, not donors. [https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/06/26/remittances-slowed-in-2023-expected-to-grow-faster-in-2024](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/06/26/remittances-slowed-in-2023-expected-to-grow-faster-in-2024)
