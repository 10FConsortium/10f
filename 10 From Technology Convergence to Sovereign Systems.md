## Abstract

Technology infrastructure is splintering into incompatible sovereign systems as nations pursue independence through different models, creating permanent fragmentation that fundamentally restructures innovation, governance and cross-border coordination.

## Key Domains

Technology Infrastructure, Digital Information Ecosystems, Global Supply Chains, Financial Architecture, Security & Military Technologies, Global Commons Governance

## Bottom Line

The old belief that technology naturally moves toward shared standards was never a law of nature. It held because dominant players benefited and global supply chains hid how concentrated the system actually was. As boundary rules harden unevenly and states/markets shoulder duplication costs to different degrees, that era is over.

Nations now pursue technological sovereignty through officially incompatible systems. This is not short-term trade turbulence but long-term structural partition—a political division of technical systems that may remain interoperable in principle yet grow increasingly segregated in practice. Distinct ecosystems are forming: the US weaponises proprietary dominance, China deploys open-source as soft power, the EU builds consortiums and India offers protocol alternatives. Yet complete separation is neither achievable nor, quietly, desired. Grey markets, middlemen states, and open-source channels ensure the walls remain porous. The result is performative decoupling—hard borders, soft flows.

Layers are fragmenting at different speeds all at once: hardware, software, standards, research networks. Each layer can split independently—different blocs control different parts. Computing power, data and access become diplomatic currency. The result reshapes how technological power works.

## Old Assumptions

* **Technical Efficiency Drives Adoption:** Superior technical solutions naturally become global standards, regardless of origin. The Silicon Valley mythology held that the best technology wins through meritocratic competition—market forces serving as neutral arbiters of quality.  
* **Open Research Accelerates Innovation:** Free flow of expertise, data and collaboration across borders produces faster technological advancement than closed systems. Tim Berners-Lee invented the web at CERN and gave it to the world, as the scientific community operated as a borderless network where talent migrated toward opportunity.  
* **Global Markets Demand Interoperability:** Products designed for universal compatibility achieve economies of scale that closed systems cannot match. Building for seven billion customers was always more profitable than building for national markets.  
* **Market Scale and Economic Logic Drive Convergence:** Market efficiency and technical superiority naturally concentrate technology development in optimal locations. Geographic concentration was understood as rational optimisation rather than strategic vulnerability.

## Emerging Norms

* **Incompatibility as Feature, Not Bug:** Deliberate non-interoperability with dominant systems becomes policy objective rather than a problem to solve. The inability to connect to foreign platforms is increasingly a design goal rather than development failure.  
* **Controlled Knowledge Production Within Blocs:** Research and development operate within trusted networks bounded by geopolitical alignment. The question of "who can know" now precedes "what can we discover."  
* **Sovereignty Architecture Replaces Efficiency Optimisation:** Nations and blocs deliberately choose technological sovereignty over optimisation, accepting higher costs for autonomy. Redundancy and localisation now represent features rather than inefficiencies.  
* **State-Market Boundaries Dissolve:** States move from arms-length regulation to direct equity participation in strategic technology companies—what might be called state-capital fusion, where governments align corporate incentives with national security objectives through equity stakes, key contracts and procurement guarantees rather than regulation alone. The line between public policy and corporate strategy blurs.  
* **Performed Sovereignty, Practical Porosity:** Official incompatibility coexists with unofficial flows; states need to demonstrate independence while middlemen maintain the connections both sides quietly require.

## The Transformation

Technology development after the Cold War followed predictable paths. International bodies governed through consensus standards. Manufacturing optimised across global networks. Products aimed for universal compatibility.

Early signals of divergence accumulated over a decade. India launched Aadhaar in 2009, demonstrating that large-scale digital infrastructure could be built independently of Western platforms. Snowden's 2013 revelations awakened surveillance concerns. COVID-19 exposed the brittleness of geographic concentration.

Recent events accelerated dynamics already underway. Russia's 2022 Ukraine invasion led to the weaponisation of technology infrastructure through Starlink deployment, SWIFT cutoffs and sanctions exploiting dependencies. ChatGPT's November 2022 launch transformed abstract and marginal AI debates into concrete urgency and mainstream discourse. Israel's algorithmic targeting in Gaza revealed how dual-use systems flow from American commercial AI development to battlefield deployment. US chip export controls in October 2022 explicitly tied semiconductor access to geopolitical alignment.

Nations moved from planning to implementation. The EU committed €12B for satellite constellations to rival Starlink. Vietnam built sovereign AI infrastructure, refusing both American and Chinese models. The United States recently took equity stakes in Intel, mirroring the state-capital fusion it previously opposed, and has floated ideas about equity stakes in other recipients of CHIPS Act grants. China is undermining US winner-takes-all dominance through open-source proliferation. 

By flooding markets with accessible models, China prevents any single player from capturing AI leadership while maintaining domestic control through deployment approval requirements—open-source code diffuses freely, but serving models to Chinese users requires government authorisation. Beijing controls implementation while letting code proliferate globally. India builds protocol-based alternatives, enabling interoperability without platform lock-in.

Fragmentation operates vertically, not just horizontally. Horizontal fragmentation divides markets geographically between blocs. Vertical fragmentation splits the technology stack itself, where different blocs control different layers—hardware, software, standards, data—within the same geographic market. Sovereignty claims work independently at each infrastructure layer. Africa illustrates this: Chinese hardware dominates through its Transsion devices and Huawei data centres, while US software platforms control applications. Kenya leads globally in ChatGPT adoption at 42% of internet users. Different blocs control different layers within the same markets.

This dynamic is reshaping how technological power works. Resources duplicate as research fragments into smaller, isolated networks. Cross-border collaboration becomes structurally harder when scientists face funding restrictions tied to geopolitical alignment. The fiction of neutral infrastructure collapsed when platforms became weapons during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Meanwhile, permeability persists: an estimated 40,000 NVIDIA GPUs operate in China despite export controls, according to some market analysts. This permeability is structural, not incidental—complete separation would collapse systems that depend on access to capabilities they officially reject.

Data centre locations become national security decisions. The global circulation of technical talent that enabled Silicon Valley's dominance is reversing as nations hoard their own sovereign tech workforce. When public funding and state guarantees—contracts, procurement, regulatory protection—underwrite duplication, parallel stacks advance. Without them, firms and users face higher costs and shorter planning horizons.

Private sector adaptation reveals the depth of fragmentation. Microsoft operates Azure China through 21Vianet as a completely separate entity. Meta, Google, Amazon and Alibaba maintain regional data centres with country-specific architectures. ASML, the semiconductor equipment giant, navigates contradictory export controls from allied nations. Submarine cables reroute to avoid certain territories.

The irony is that democratic and authoritarian systems converge toward similar state-technology integration even as sovereignty imperatives fragment allies. The toolkit is converging even as the blocs diverge. US export controls tier even NATO allies differently—Portugal and Austria face restrictions, while Germany does not. The EU's response fragments further: OpenEuroLLM and EuroLLM launched as separate projects with overlapping goals, while individual member states build parallel sovereign AI systems rather than pooling resources.

Protocol-based alternatives offer a structurally different path. India Stack provides public infrastructure layers (Aadhaar for identity, UPI for payments) enabling interoperability without platform lock-in. Unlike platforms (Visa, AWS, Meta), which mediate all interactions through proprietary infrastructure they control, protocols define rules for communication that multiple providers can implement independently—UPI lets any bank process payments through shared standards rather than routing everything through a single network. Though protocol openness hasn't prevented the Indian state from using these systems for surveillance and exclusion. The model demonstrates that sovereignty needn't require vertical integration, but adoption at scale would require the US, China and EU to embrace interoperability over control. Neither outcome seems likely. The result is grinding inefficiency that achieves neither the security fragmentation promises nor the innovation convergence enabled.

## Strategic Blind Spots

* **System Misperception:** Organisations pursuing technological sovereignty systematically misperceive critical dimensions of the transformation, leading to strategic errors that compound costs while failing to achieve security objectives.  
* **Underestimating Required Scale:** Naive national players waking up late to the game are investing sums that seem large to them but are too small by orders of magnitude. The UK invests $1.3 billion in semiconductors, when competitive scale could require an estimated $260 billion. Similarly, the EU's $12 billion satellite constellation barely reaches entry stakes in a game where Starlink has already invested $30 billion.  
* **Ignoring Nested Dependencies:** 90+% of advanced semiconductor manufacturing concentrates in Taiwan and South Korea. Reshoring chip fabrication doesn't address equipment dependencies—TSMC and other chipmakers cannot produce advanced semiconductors without machines from the Dutch firm ASML, whose supply chain alone spans over 1,000 suppliers across multiple countries.  
* **Delusional Pursuit of Decoupling:** High-end tech supply chains have deep, nested cross-border dependencies that are hard to uproot. The US CHIPS Act—designed to reshore semiconductor manufacturing and reduce dependence on East Asian production, particularly Taiwan—allocated $53 billion, the equivalent of roughly two years of TSMC's capital spending, representing a minimal investment compared to what full decoupling would require. Dependencies remain structurally irreversible within critical timeframes—advanced semiconductor fabs require not just $20+ billion in capital but also years of yield optimisation and workforce development; Intel's most advanced US facilities won't reach competitive production until 2027-2028 at earliest. Meanwhile strategic decisions cannot wait. Decoupling is performed for domestic and strategic legitimacy, not achieved in practice. The goal is controllable dependence, not independence—but policy often mistakes the performance for the objective.  
* **Fragmenting Even Among Allies:** The EU launched six overlapping sovereign LLM projects within months. Exclusion rules prevent collaboration between aligned nations. Sovereignty imperatives create coordination failures at every scale.

## Global Implications

* **Innovation Fragments and Duplicates:** Research networks fragment into smaller, less diverse pools. Duplicate sovereign projects with overlapping goals, spread insufficient funding across sprawling consortia. Loss of cross-pollination reduces breakthrough potential.  
* **States and Markets Converge:** Democratic and authoritarian systems adopt similar structures in strategic technology. The US government has taken a 10% equity stake in Intel, mirroring Chinese state-capital fusion. Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the UAE make strategic compute purchases, treating semiconductors as sovereign assets. Free market pretence is increasingly dissolving as states move from regulation to direct participation, ending the fiction that competitive markets determine strategic technology development.  
* **Technical Standards Become Trade Barriers:** Incompatible standards and compliance requirements are creating friction equivalent to tariffs. Data localisation is forcing organisations to maintain parallel systems per jurisdiction. Technical incompatibilities are raising costs and limiting flows between nominally-aligned nations. Digital borders may prove harder than physical ones.  
* **Trust Infrastructure Erodes:** Russia-Ukraine demonstrated that platforms can be critical assets (Starlink), payment systems weaponised and technology dependencies as attack vectors. Russia's partial exclusion from SWIFT—the messaging network connecting 11,000+ financial institutions globally—showed that financial infrastructure presumed neutral could be turned against users. Each weaponisation episode erodes trust, driving more sovereignty pursuits. As trust falls, boundary rules tighten, which fragments systems further, creating more weaponisation opportunities—a recursive spiral with no natural floor.

## Strategic Landscape

### Architecting 

* Major powers (US, China, EU) building sovereign technology stacks through state-capital fusion, implementing export controls and funding domestic production  
* Gulf states (UAE, Saudi Arabia) investing $100B+ in AI data centres and chip access, treating compute as a sovereign asset alongside oil  
* India building public infrastructure layers (Aadhaar, UPI) enabling interoperability without platform lock-in, offering sovereignty through open standards  
* US attacking EU tech regulation (Digital Markets Act, Digital Services Act) as protectionism, with sovereignty imperatives creating conflict even among allies

### Resisting 

* Big Tech platforms lobbying to maintain global markets, arguing fragmentation threatens innovation  
* Standards bodies (IEEE, W3C, ISO) attempting to preserve consensus-based technical standards against geopolitical capture  
* Research communities resisting funding restrictions tied to nationality and security clearance**s**

### Exploiting 

* Equipment suppliers (ASML, Trumpf, Zeiss) manoeuvring to maintain access to both US and Chinese markets despite contradictory export controls  
* Gray market networks operating chip circumvention through Shenzhen markets, with an estimated 40,000 NVIDIA GPUs reaching China despite bans  
* National security tech firms (Oracle, Palantir, defence contractors) aligning with sovereignty narrative to capture government budgets  
* Big Tech selectively embracing fragmentation when regulatory compliance costs create barriers smaller competitors cannot afford

### Avoiding 

* Open source communities creating transnational diffusion through open-weight models operating across bloc boundaries  
* Third-way nations (Vietnam, Indonesia) building sovereign systems refusing both US and Chinese dependencies  
* Southern African regional initiatives investing in shared infrastructure to avoid bilateral dependency on major powers  
* Smaller nations maintaining minimal digital infrastructure, avoiding forced alignment through deliberate non-participation

### Shaped 

* Infrastructure-dependent nations running digital systems entirely on foreign platforms, with alignment determined by whoever built the infrastructure  
* Technology workers facing career mobility limited by bloc boundaries, visa restrictions and security clearance requirements  
* Organisations caught in export control regimes, dependent on components subject to unpredictable restrictions  
* SMEs unable to afford parallel compliance systems per jurisdiction, forced to choose markets or exit entirely

## Scenario Pathways

### Bloc Rigidity Calcifies

The United States successfully maintains closed vertical integration through state-capital fusion. China's open-source strategy prevents a US global monopoly while maintaining state control. India's protocol alternatives function in Southeast Asia. The EU attempts sovereignty but eventually adopts US approaches—like today's Western internet dominated by American companies. Multiple viable but incompatible ecosystems emerge, each refusing the others on security and political grounds.

Each bloc operates successfully within its boundaries but at higher cost. Western companies serve smaller but wealthier markets. Chinese and Indian alternatives serve larger but more fragmented ones. Organisations maintain parallel systems per jurisdiction—expensive but manageable. Compliance becomes a profitable industry. Grey channels persist and professionalise—middlemen states like Singapore and the UAE position themselves as neutral translation layers and arbitrage specialists extract rents from moving chips, talent and code across officially impermeable boundaries. The harder the borders perform, the more the soft flows are worth.

The result is stable but suboptimal: security through separation, innovation sacrificed to fragmentation. Success requires optimising for regional markets, minimising duplication costs and accepting permanently higher operational complexity.

**Adaptive Strategies**

* **Organisations:** Accept tripolar reality and optimise for chosen bloc rather than global reach. Turn compliance divisions into profit centres serving others navigating the same constraints.  
* **Communities:** Build parallel support structures, anticipating loss of cross-bloc services. Develop information networks that function despite bloc boundaries.  
* **Individuals:** Choose primary bloc alignment based on long-term life plans, not current convenience. Maintain multiple digital identities for navigating different bloc requirements.  
* **Advocates:** Focus on harm reduction within blocs rather than fighting fragmentation. Build workarounds for essential humanitarian operations across incompatible systems.

### Cascade Failure Reveals Fatal Dependencies

Taiwan experiences major disruption—invasion, earthquake, or infrastructure failure. Advanced semiconductor manufacturing concentrated in a single vulnerable geography proves irreplaceable within critical timeframes. US AI capabilities collapse as chip supplies evaporate. Military and intelligence systems degrade simultaneously.

Nested dependencies emerge everywhere. Reshoring chip fabrication doesn't address equipment dependencies spanning thousands of suppliers globally. Hardware depreciation cycles mean datacentres become obsolete faster than domestic production can replace them. Your phone works but can't talk to critical infrastructure. Modern life doesn't end—it becomes incrementally more impossible.

**Adaptive Strategies**

* **Organisations:** Strip operations to essential functions and shift from efficiency to survival optimisation. Build redundancy through older, repairable technologies with local supply chains.  
* **Communities:** Resurrect analogue systems before digital infrastructure fully fails. Form geographic mutual aid networks that don't require digital mediation.  
* **Individuals:** Learn repair over replacement and develop analogue skills like navigation without GPS. Build local relationship networks and maintain physical copies of critical information.  
* **Advocates:** Shift from policy advocacy to practical mutual aid organising. Create training programs for essential analogue skills and alternative information distribution.

### Protocol Diversity Prevails

Middle powers successfully scale protocol-based alternatives pioneered by India and Vietnam. Multiple nations adopt protocol approaches—public sectors building interoperable digital rails, while private sectors innovate without platform lock-in. Open-weight AI models proliferate faster than proprietary systems, as efficiency innovations prove more valuable than raw scale.

Organisations discover that sovereignty through protocols enables genuine competition while maintaining cross-border flows. Gateway nations position themselves as neutral infrastructure hosts. The result is diversification into multiple viable configurations rather than convergence to single standards. Interoperability becomes competitive advantage rather than constraint. Success requires organisations investing in protocol literacy, nations building interoperable infrastructure and smaller states leveraging neutral hosts.

**Adaptive Strategies**

* **Organisations:** Build protocol-first architectures and create value through interoperability services. Develop "protocol arbitrage" capabilities to identify which protocols work best for specific functions.  
* **Communities:** Form protocol cooperatives that maintain shared infrastructure without corporate capture. Build protocol literacy programs, teaching members to navigate multiple systems.  
* **Individuals:** Develop fluency across multiple protocol systems rather than platform expertise. Maintain portable professional identity that can export/import across protocols.  
* **Advocates:** Champion protocol standards in regulatory frameworks over platform-specific rules. Build coalitions across protocol communities to prevent fragmentation.
