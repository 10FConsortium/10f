## Abstract

The climate window is narrowing just as the energy transition fragments into competing systems, each embedding dependencies that will shape emissions through 2070\.

## Key Domains

Energy Systems, Climate Mitigation & Adaptation, Global Commons Governance, Global Supply Chains, Trade Systems, Security Alliances & Military Technologies

## Bottom Line

The energy transition is not converging toward a single integrated system. It is diverging into competing electro-digital architectures, stacks that bundle physical infrastructure, digital coordination, mineral inputs, manufacturing capacity, standards, institutions and financing rules.

The United States, European Union and China are each building distinct stacks. They are not incompatible in theory, but they embed different technological assumptions, governance models, industrial priorities and digital ecosystems. The longer they evolve separately, the higher the switching costs and the more difficult cross-architecture interoperability becomes.  
   
The current reality reverses the logic that multilateral governance and coordinated frameworks would strengthen over time. Instead, fragmentation is persistent and transitions are being driven by industrial strategy, market competition and rapid shifts in demand and technology, inside a fractured geopolitical environment.

## Old Assumptions  

* **Convergence Through Shared Frameworks:** Standards for fuels, technologies, measurement and reporting were expected to converge, letting markets and institutions operate within a coherent global framework.   
* **Demand Shaped by Policy-led Coordination:** End-use sectors—transport, buildings, industry—were expected to decarbonise through predictable regulation, coordinated technology standards and gradually rising carbon prices.  
* **Technology Diffusion in an Orderly System:** Cost declines in solar, wind and storage were expected to drive broad global adoption, with technology diffusion reinforcing convergence rather than splintering into competing architectures.  
* **Energy Security Expands Without Fracturing:** Energy security was expected to broaden through reliability, affordability and environmental performance, while remaining anchored in shared frameworks.  
* **Digital Systems Support Energy Transitions:** Digitalisation was expected to improve efficiency and grid operations but was not treated as a new strategic domain that could itself shape geopolitical alignments or system control.  
* **Strengthening Multilateral Governance:** From Kyoto through the early Paris era, the dominant expectation was that global climate governance would gradually tighten toward coordinated decarbonisation.

## Emerging Norms

* **Persistent Fragmentation:** Major powers are embedding divergent assumptions into energy and digital infrastructure—through industrial policy, export controls, standards and weaponised interdependence.  
* **Transition Through Industrial Strategy and Demand Shifts:** Cost declines remain essential, but deployment is shaped by industrial policy and demand-chain transformations. Transitions accelerate when end-use technologies transform—not when fuels alone shift.  
* **More Dependencies Not Fewer:** The transition reduces reliance on oil and gas but increases reliance on minerals, processing, grid hardware and digital infrastructure.   
* **Energy Transitions Are Additive:** Coal, oil, gas, renewables and nuclear coexist. No major economy has fully retired its legacy system even as it scales the new.  
* **Digital Capability and Platform Leverage:** Digital coordination shapes system feasibility, digital asymmetry shapes vulnerability. As energy shifts from commodity markets to orchestrated architectures, control concentrates in those who manage interfaces, algorithms and data.  
* **Fragmenting Human Rights:** What was expected to be a universal standard is becoming another domain where architectures diverge.

## The Transformation

In April 2025, China tightened export controls on rare earth magnets. Within weeks, Ford had to idle multiple plants. CEO Jim Farley was clear: "We cannot get any high-powered magnets without China. We shut down plants for the last three weeks." Not batteries, windscreen wipers, seats, or audio systems, he noted. "It's hand-to-mouth right now."

For a century, energy security meant access to fuel—oil fields, pipelines, shipping lanes. Now it centres on minerals and processing, manufacturing ecosystems, transmission corridors, digital coordination platforms, data centres, cyber resilience and standards regimes.

Both systems are now vulnerable. The old fossil system's chokepoints, oil fields and shipping lanes, remain exposed. The new electro-digital system's dependencies—minerals, grids, processing, digital coordination—aren't yet diversified. Dual exposure defines the 2020s.

But whatever the pathway, the destination is electrical—and in key sectors, adoption has passed the tipping point. The most decisive momentum now originates in end-use demand chains, especially electrification of mobility, heat pumps, industrial efficiency, low-carbon and materials, which is often accelerated by local governments through building codes, EV mandates and siting decisions.

In Latin America—Brazil, Chile, Uruguay—market-led renewable build is outpacing policy frameworks, driven by competitive costs, private power purchase agreements (PPAs) and distributed solar. These countries are not aligning to a major stack, they are building capacity outside the architect logic, complicating any simple tripartite map.

​​Electrification changes more than the energy mix. It changes the architecture of power.

Oil is fungible—a barrel from anywhere trades on world markets, ships by tanker, stockpiles for emergencies. Electricity isn't. It can't be stockpiled at scale or shipped across oceans. It flows through fixed infrastructure that encodes its builders' choices. The longer regional systems develop separately, the harder they become to bridge. Oil tolerated geopolitical competition because the commodity moved through markets. Electrical systems embed competition into infrastructure. As systems electrify and distribute, digital coordination—real-time optimisation, forecasting, cyber resilience—becomes decisive. Control shifts from those who own resources to those who orchestrate flows.

As regional systems solidify or harden, a new taxonomy of power and leverage emerges. The game changes when power comes from what you build, not what you extract.

Unlike the Cold War's rigid binary, a set of corridor states are positioning themselves as bridges. Türkiye is building its role as a gas hub between Russia, Central Asia and Europe. Singapore is becoming for energy trading what Geneva has been for commodities—a neutral clearing house where standards get set and transactions brokered. The Gulf states are investing across Western and Asian markets, across fossil and clean systems, positioned to profit regardless of which future arrives—buying optionality across all systems. 

Petrostates are splitting: electrostates organised around surplus, versus petrostates organised around scarcity rents. China is building an electro state. Russia and the Gulf remain petrostates—one as breaker, the others as insurers. The US is paradoxical: electrostate capacity married to petrostate identity, politics and military positioning, as seen in its current stance toward Venezuela.

Beyond electrostates and petrostates, a fuller taxonomy is emerging: platform-states and platform-corporations deriving leverage from cloud infrastructure, grid algorithms and data standards. Mineral-leverage states are shaping supply through export rules, while swing states navigate between security alignments and supply chain dependencies. Digitally fragile states face systemic vulnerability, and prosumer-enabling jurisdictions build local resilience through distributed energy and digital coordination.

No major power has resolved its position. China's hedge is strategic: dominant in clean tech at home, record oil and gas engagement abroad. The US hedge is incoherent: record oil production alongside Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsidies, a bet-both-ways outcome through policy fragmentation rather than design. The EU's hedge is conditional: green targets it can't meet without Chinese imports, liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts locked in within months of Russian cutoff. All three are managing the same uncertainty—but only China's hedge looks fully deliberate.

## Strategic Blindspots

* **Underestimating Path-dependence:** Path-dependence is often acknowledged in principle but underweighted in practice. Scenario analyses and investment decisions frequently assume more flexibility than architectures allow. Switching costs accumulate faster than most models anticipate.  
* **Overlooking Digital Asymmetry:** Countries with weak data governance, cyber capability and platform regulation face elevated vulnerability despite having renewable potential.  
* **Distributed Assets vs Decentralised Authority:** Distributed energy resources (DERs) do not automatically distribute power—authority is often centralised through proprietary platforms.  
* **Assuming Mineral Dependencies Are Static:** Alternative chemistries (sodium-ion, iron-air, solid-state) and circular strategies may shift chokepoints. Today's bottlenecks could become tomorrow's stranded assets.  
* **Underestimating Deployment Constraints:** Transmission lines, renewable installations, mines and data centres face ecological, planning and cultural constraints that shape feasible trajectories. AI and cloud demand add localised stress on grids and water systems. Governance is not adapting at the pace of deployment.  
* **Nuclear Surging Into a Governance Gap:** Nuclear capacity is set to grow by a third by 2035\. Over 40 countries now include it in their energy strategies and over 30 have the technical base to build weapons.   
* **Climate-Vulnerable Supply Chains:** Energy transition requires minerals from places that climate change is making less stable. The DRC (cobalt), Chile (lithium/copper), and Indonesia (nickel) are not climate-insulated zones.  
* **Undervaluing Cross-stack Navigation:** Navigating three architectures simultaneously requires system-mapping capacity that most states and firms lack—those who develop it extract outsized value from fragmentation.

## Global System Implications

* **Incompatible Architectures:** The divergence is architectural rather than definitional. Incompatibility arises from grid codes, data rules, cyber protocols, hydrogen standards, mineral governance and digital identity systems. Interoperability becomes costly.  
* **System Competition:** Tools originally designed for climate or market coordination now serve strategic functions. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was designed for convergence—shared targets, common accounting, coordinated action.  
* **Harmonisation Shifts to Translation:** The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy were designed for convergence—shared frameworks, common standards. Now, a new function emerges: verification, mutual recognition and bridging across incompatible systems.  
* **Capability as a Primary Divide:** Digital, organisational and regulatory capabilities now shape system resilience more than physical resources. Countries with strong governance, cyber infrastructure and platform capacity pull ahead as those without face compounding disadvantages.

## AREAS Strategic Landscape

### Architecting

* Electro-state Asia building world-leading renewable capacity and grid expansion under tight state governance while retaining coal for flexibility  
* European Union, Nordics and Iberia constructing advanced interconnection, demand response and long-duration storage with high policy durability

* South Africa and other grid-fixers requiring external capital and governance reform due to historical under-investment  
* Extraction-zone communities (Atacama, Northern Territory/Queensland, Xinjiang, Alberta, Rajasthan) subject to global demand for minerals and renewables  
* Workers in transitional coal, automotive and heavy manufacturing industries  
* African and South Asian utilities contending with grid weakness, diesel fallback, concessional finance and digital dependencies  
* Industrial exporters navigating Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), hydrogen rules and Western compliance frameworks they do not control  
* Digitally fragile states dependent on foreign cloud infrastructure and hardware ecosystems with uneven cyber capability

## Scenarios

### Mosaic Interoperability

Architectures remain distinct but converge on open standards for key technologies, shared cyber norms, interoperable data layers and aligned regulatory baselines for minerals and digital systems. No single stack dominates, instead, interfaces become the site of coordination. Cities, regions, firms and civic actors shape system evolution through distributed innovation. Non-aligned states gain leverage as bridge-builders rather than choosing sides. Decarbonisation accelerates through coordinated demand-chain transformation and interoperable architectures. 1.5-2°C becomes achievable. Power disperses rather than consolidates.

**Adaptive Strategies:**

* Organisations: Invest in interoperability—standards literacy, cross-architecture partnerships, and platform-neutral systems that can operate across multiple regulatory environments.  
* Communities: Leverage distributed energy and local coordination capacity; in a mosaic system, local actors shape outcomes rather than waiting for stack-level decisions.  
* Individuals: Bridging skills—cross-system technical knowledge, multilingual capacity, relationships across boundaries—become more valuable than deep specialisation in one architecture.  
* Advocates: Push for open standards and interface governance; the window for shaping interoperability norms is narrow, and early choices will lock in.

### Managed Fragmentation

The stacks remain distinct but don't fully harden. Pragmatic deals emerge at the interfaces—mutual recognition of some standards, critical mineral agreements, grid interconnection protocols that bridge systems. The navigators (India, Indonesia, Brazil, African mineral holders) exploit the competition, extracting better terms from each stack. The US and China find narrow areas of cooperation (nuclear safety, grid security) even as they compete. Climate outcomes improve slightly—not coordination, but parallel acceleration. 2°C becomes possible if deployment continues at pace. Old and new systems coexist uncomfortably. No clear resolution emerges, but the system functions well enough to muddle through. Pragmatic deals emerge over 10–15 years with no resolution by 2050, but the system still functions.

**Adaptive Strategies:**

* **Organisations:** Invest in translation capacity—the ability to operate across incompatible systems, manage dual compliance and broker between stacks.  
* **Communities:** Strengthen local resilience and self-sufficiency, since persistent uncertainty at the system level means external support remains unreliable.  
* **Individuals:** Bridging skills—languages, cross-system technical knowledge, relationships across boundaries—become more valuable than deep specialisation in one stack.  
* **Advocates:** Energy costs will spike and hit the vulnerable hardest—position climate solutions as energy security and affordability, not just emissions.

### System Breakdown

A major disruption hits before any stack is self-sufficient—a cyberattack on interconnected grids during peak demand, loss of access to Chinese-processed minerals, or a wider war that severs both oil chokepoints and clean tech supply chains. During the transition, both fronts are exposed: the old system's vulnerabilities persist, while the new system's dependencies aren't yet diversified. Formal coordination fragments. Countries scramble for whatever capacity they can access—reverting to coal where it exists, rationing where it doesn't. Climate goals are abandoned as survival takes precedence. Chaos creates openings: actors who maintained redundancy, local capacity, or critical skills gain outsized influence in the reconstruction. What emerges won't resemble the system that came before. A major disruption in the next 5-7 years—before any stack achieves self-sufficiency—triggers cascade.

**Adaptive Strategies:**

* **Organisations:** Build redundancy and local capacity now—those who can operate when supply chains break apart will shape what comes next.  
* **Communities:** Invest in essentials—local energy, food, water and mutual aid networks that function when larger systems don't.  
* **Individuals:** Cultivate practical skills and local ties—when larger systems fail, immediate geography and tangible capabilities matter most.  
* **Advocates:** Keep climate on the reconstruction agenda—crises create openings for new systems and what gets built in the aftermath will lock in for decades.

## Current Signals

**Signal 1: Critical Mineral Dominance Weaponized in Trade Disputes**

As energy security shifts from fuel access to supply chain control, major powers are treating processing dominance and technology bottlenecks as instruments of leverage—mirroring how oil embargoes functioned in the previous era.

**Recent examples:**

* In October 2022, the US imposed sweeping export controls on advanced semiconductors and manufacturing equipment to China—described as "the most expansive export control action in decades." [https://www.csis.org/analysis/limits-chip-export-controls-meeting-china-challenge](https://www.csis.org/analysis/limits-chip-export-controls-meeting-china-challenge)  
* China responded by escalating critical mineral restrictions imposing export controls on seven heavy rare earth elements, then expanded these to require licenses for any products containing Chinese-sourced rare earths. [https://www.iea.org/commentaries/with-new-export-controls-on-critical-minerals-supply-concentration-risks-become-reality](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/with-new-export-controls-on-critical-minerals-supply-concentration-risks-become-reality)

**Signal 2: Alternative Battery Chemistries Emerging to Bypass Existing Chokepoints**

Sodium-ion and iron-air batteries are moving from laboratory to commercial production, potentially disrupting lithium and cobalt dependencies before supply chain lock-in completes.

**Recent examples:**

* In April 2025, Chinese battery maker CATL began mass production of its Naxtra sodium-ion battery, achieving 175 Wh/kg energy density—approaching parity with lithium iron phosphate batteries. [https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Sodium-ion-batteries-Should-believe/103/web/2025/11](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Sodium-ion-batteries-Should-believe/103/web/2025/11)  
* Form Energy's iron-air battery completed its first US manufacturing plant in West Virginia and announced an 85-megawatt facility in Maine. The company claims storage costs at one-tenth of lithium-ion for 100-hour duration. [https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/01/1104382/2024-climate-tech-companies-form-energy-iron-batteries/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/01/1104382/2024-climate-tech-companies-form-energy-iron-batteries/)

**Signal 3: Climate Vulnerability Threatening Transition Mineral Supply Chains**

The critical minerals required for the energy transition are concentrated in regions increasingly exposed to climate-related disruption, creating a feedback loop between transition progress and supply security.

**Recent examples:**

* A PwC study found that countries leading cobalt and lithium production—Australia, Chile, the DRC, and Peru—are experiencing rising drought, putting at risk up to 74% of cobalt and lithium production capacity by 2050 under extreme heating scenarios. [https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/04/30/more-than-70-of-key-resources-imperilled-by-climate-report](https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/04/30/more-than-70-of-key-resources-imperilled-by-climate-report)  
* The DRC accounts for approximately 70% of global cobalt supply, while Chile provides 25% of lithium production. Both face compound risks: climate stress on extraction processes alongside growing resource nationalism.

**Signal 4: Connector States Positioning as Energy Intermediaries Between Blocs**

As the Ukraine transit route closed, Türkiye, Singapore and the Gulf states are building infrastructure to intermediate energy flows between fragmenting systems.

**Recent examples:**

* Türkiye is negotiating with Russia to establish a gas trading hub in Istanbul that could begin operations in 2025, allowing Russian gas to reach European markets relabeled as "Turkish blend." [https://nordicmonitor.com/2025/01/turkey-to-position-itself-as-potential-russian-gas-transit-hub-for-europe-despite-sanctions/](https://nordicmonitor.com/2025/01/turkey-to-position-itself-as-potential-russian-gas-transit-hub-for-europe-despite-sanctions/)  
* Singapore traded approximately $240 billion worth of LNG in 2022—equivalent to 50% of its GDP—despite producing none domestically. [https://www.jtc.gov.sg/about-jtc/news-and-stories/feature-stories/singapore-a-vital-link-in-the-global-energy-supply-chain](https://www.jtc.gov.sg/about-jtc/news-and-stories/feature-stories/singapore-a-vital-link-in-the-global-energy-supply-chain)  
* Gulf sovereign wealth funds are investing across both Western and Chinese clean energy markets. [https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/Industries/investment-management/perspectives/gulf-cooperation-council-sovereign-wealth-funds.html](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/Industries/investment-management/perspectives/gulf-cooperation-council-sovereign-wealth-funds.html)

**Signal 5: Technical Standards Fragment into Competing Protocol Blocs**

The new system embeds control at the protocol layer. EV charging has fractured into four regional charging standards: China's GB/T, Europe's CCS2, North America's NACS, and Japan's CHAdeMO.

**Recent examples:**

* China's National Standardization Development Outline (2021) treats technical standards as geopolitical instruments, with explicit goals to shape international norms for AI, EVs and renewable energy. [https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-standards-2035-strategy-recent-developments-and-their-implications-foreign-companies/](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-standards-2035-strategy-recent-developments-and-their-implications-foreign-companies/)  
* The EU's Delegated Regulations (2023) apply "regardless of whether renewable hydrogen is produced inside or outside the territory of the Union"—non-EU producers must meet EU additionality rules to access European markets. [https://www.europeanlawblog.eu/pub/1b1jgmw6](https://www.europeanlawblog.eu/pub/1b1jgmw6)
