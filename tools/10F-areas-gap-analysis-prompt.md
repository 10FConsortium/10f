## A structured prompt for using AI tools with the AREAS Framework

## What this is

This is a structured prompt for running strategic gap analysis using the AREAS Framework developed by the 10F Consortium. You can use it with Claude, ChatGPT, or any capable AI assistant.

The prompt works best when you've already done the human work: mapping your transformation, identifying relevant actors, and placing them into AREAS positions. The AI's job is to stress-test your mapping, surface blind spots, and identify structural barriers and dependencies you might be too close to see.

The quality of output depends entirely on the quality of your input. Honest mapping produces useful analysis. Wishful mapping produces consulting boilerplate.

## Before you start

You'll need to prepare two things:

### 1. Define your transformation

Pick a specific shift you're tracking. Frame it as a "From → To" if that helps. Examples:
- From centralised energy control → fragmented energy sovereignty
- From open academic exchange → restricted knowledge flows
- From multilateral climate cooperation → bilateral climate deals
- From dollar-denominated trade → competing payment systems

Be specific. "The world is changing" isn't a transformation. "Our donor base is shifting from US government funding to Gulf sovereign wealth" is.

### 2. Map your actors into AREAS positions

For your chosen transformation, identify the relevant actors — states, organisations, platforms, sectors, communities, networks — and place each one into an AREAS position. Use these recognition questions to guide your placement:

**Architecting** — Who's writing the new rules? Who's funding the infrastructure? Who's building the system others will have to operate in?

**Resisting** — Who's fighting it? Who's defending existing arrangements? Who's blocking implementation? Who's organising opposition?

**Exploiting** — Who's making money from the friction? Who saw the opportunity early? Who's positioned as a broker between incompatible systems? Who's capitalising on newly scarce resources?

**Avoiding** — Who's building walls? Who's claiming neutrality? Who's maintaining old arrangements in isolated pockets? Who's building parallel systems?

**Shaped** — Who's responding to changes they didn't choose? Who's adapting because alternatives disappeared? Who's navigating rather than steering?

You can also note the scale each actor operates at: Global (nation-states, multinationals, global platforms), Regional/Sectoral (industries, regional blocs, sector regulators), or Local (municipalities, communities, individual organisations).

### Optional: Map a preferred future

If you want gap analysis rather than just a landscape reading, create a second map showing where you'd *want* actors to be positioned for your organisation to have more room to operate. Not utopia — plausible repositioning.

You are a strategic analyst. I'm going to give you a transformation I'm tracking and a mapping of actors into strategic positions using the AREAS Framework. Your job is to analyse the landscape honestly. No consulting language. No generic recommendations. Every observation should be traceable to the mapping I provide.

## THE AREAS FRAMEWORK

AREAS maps what actors are DOING in response to systemic change — not who they are or what they claim. Five positions:

- Architecting — Creating and controlling the transformation. Setting rules, building infrastructure, defining parameters. Maximum agency.
- Resisting — Fighting against the transformation. Active opposition, regulatory pushback, building barriers. Moderate agency (requires resources).
- Exploiting — Arbitraging gaps and friction between systems. Finding profit in friction, bridging incompatible systems. Moderate-high agency.
- Avoiding — Bypassing through parallel systems. Building alternatives, selective disengagement. Variable agency.
- Shaped — Being shaped by forces beyond meaningful control. Adapting within constraints. Minimal agency. Not passive, but navigating rather than steering.

Key principles:
- Positions are contextual. The same actor can Architect in one domain while being Shaped in another.
- Actors can occupy multiple positions simultaneously.
- No moral hierarchy. Architecting isn't "better" than being Shaped. Exploiting isn't inherently negative. Resisting can be progressive or reactionary.
- Movement between positions is possible. Crises, resources, and capability shifts can reposition actors.
- Positions interact. Architecting creates Exploiting opportunities. Resisting may force Architects to modify. Those Shaped may organise to Resist or Avoid.

## MY TRANSFORMATION

[Describe the shift you're tracking. Be specific. Include context about why this matters to your organisation.]

## PRESENT MAP — Where actors currently sit

Architecting:
[List actors and brief notes on what they're building/controlling. Note scale: Global, Regional/Sectoral, or Local.]

Resisting:
[List actors and what they're fighting to preserve or prevent.]

Exploiting:
[List actors and what gaps/friction they're working.]

Avoiding:
[List actors and what parallel systems they're building or maintaining.]

Shaped:
[List actors and what forces are reshaping them.]

## PREFERRED FUTURE MAP (optional — include if you want gap analysis)

[Same structure as above, but showing where you'd want actors positioned for your organisation to have more room to operate. Not ideal outcomes — plausible repositioning.]

## WHAT I WANT FROM YOU

Analyse this mapping. Specifically:

1. Landscape reading: What does the overall distribution of actors tell you? Which positions are crowded? Which are empty? What does that suggest about the transformation's trajectory?

2. Vulnerabilities: Where are actors in positions they probably can't sustain? Who looks stable but has hidden fragility? Who's being shaped but could move?

3. Coalitions: Where might actors in different positions share interests that aren't obvious from identity-based analysis? Where are there potential alliances that conventional groupings would miss?

4. If I included a preferred future map — gap analysis:
   - Which shifts are plausible and which are structurally blocked?
   - What has to happen first before other shifts become possible? (dependency chains)
   - What am I assuming that might not hold?
   - What actors or dynamics am I missing from the map entirely?

5. Blind spots: What's missing from my mapping? Actors I haven't placed? Interactions I haven't considered? Assumptions I haven't examined?

Be direct. If a shift I want is unrealistic, say so. If my mapping has obvious biases, name them. The goal is to see the landscape clearly, not to feel good about it.

## Tips for better results

- **Be specific in your actor placement.** "Government" is too vague. "Indonesia's Ministry of Trade" gives the AI something to work with.
- **Include actors you're uncomfortable placing.** If you're not sure where an actor sits, include them with a note saying so. Ambiguity is information.
- **Don't skip Shaped.** People tend to over-map Architecting and under-map Shaped. The actors being reshaped by forces they didn't choose often reveal the most about the transformation's actual dynamics.
- **Expect the preferred future to be the hardest part.** Mapping the present is observation. Mapping the preferred future forces you to commit to what you actually want — which actors you need to move, which positions you're willing to accept, what you'd trade. Most teams find this is where the real strategic conversation starts, and where disagreements surface that were previously hidden behind vague consensus.
- **Run it more than once.** Swap out one or two actors, adjust a position, or reframe the transformation slightly and run it again. The differences between outputs tell you where your mapping is sensitive to assumptions.
- **Use the output as a starting point for conversation, not a deliverable.** The AI doesn't know your operational context. Its best function is surfacing questions you haven't asked yet.

## About AREAS

The AREAS Framework was developed by the 10F Consortium to map strategic positioning during systemic transformation. It's part of a larger body of work — ten open-access forecasts mapping major global shifts over the next decade. All materials are available at [10fconsortium.org](https://10fconsortium.org) under Creative Commons license (CC BY 4.0).

AREAS describes terrain — it doesn't prescribe moves. What position you should take depends on your resources, values, risk tolerance, and organisational culture.
