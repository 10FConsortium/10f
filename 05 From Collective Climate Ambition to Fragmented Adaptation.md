## Abstract

Global climate governance is shifting from coordinated mitigation to fragmented adaptation, as cities, states and regions build independent climate responses while multilateral frameworks stall.

## Key Domains

Climate Mitigation & Adaptation, Energy Systems, Migration & Population Movements, Civil Society & Democratic Institutions, Global Commons Governance

## Bottom Line

COP30 marked the UN's first admission that crossing 1.5°C is inevitable. Yet petrostate opposition, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, with backing from China and India, kept “fossil fuels” out of the official text—the forum can't name the problem it was built to solve. The US sent no delegation to Belém and “drill baby drill” was the message from the White House. Meanwhile, new pipelines and LNG terminals are locking in decades of more extraction. The fight to prevent catastrophic warming is being lost.

This forecast examines what comes next. Cities, states and regions are stepping in with their own bilateral partnerships, their own finance, their own adaptation plans. This distributed model may prove faster and more adaptive than top-down coordination from larger, less agile powers that have shown they won't act. But local action has limits. We may become very good at building sea walls while ignoring what's making the seas rise. 

## Old Assumptions

* **The Paris Agreement Assumptions:** These were largely Western and primarily liberal ideas of how collective action works.  
* **Collective Threat vs Collective Action:** As the cost of inaction became increasingly self-evident, nations would coordinate to prevent escalating risks to human life, ecosystems and economies.  
* **Funding Trickles Down:** Climate finance would flow mainly as grants through multilateral institutions to frontline nations, with wealthy countries fulfilling the $100 billion annual commitment.  
* **Climate Action as Policy Issue:** It would be recognised as a threat to livelihoods, security, public health and the well-being of future generations, requiring action across the political spectrum.  
* **Mitigation Outpaces Adaptation:** Coordinated emissions reduction would move fast enough that adaptation remained a secondary concern, not a primary strategy.  
* **Public Trust Grows:** Consistent messaging from credible voices, combined with direct experience of climate impacts, would build consent for difficult transitions.

## Emerging Norms

* **The UNFCCC's consensus requirement**—designed for legitimacy—has become a structural veto. At COP30, outcomes supported by the vast majority were blocked by a handful of petrostates.  
* **Loans Not Grants:** trapping vulnerable nations in debt as climate disasters erode their economies. Those most exposed to climate impacts are being left to design and fund their own survival strategies.  
* **Alliances Mirror Blocs:** Major powers pressure their trade partners to adopt their preferred energy systems.  
* **Partnerships Filling Gaps:** As patience with national inaction wears thin, those closest to citizens are shouldering greater responsibility for climate action.  
* **Indigenous Peoples Leading:** They are more visible than ever at climate forums—COP30 had the largest attendance in history—but presence isn't participation. Only 14% of Brazilian Indigenous delegates could access negotiating spaces; none could vote or speak in closed sessions.  
* **Climate-threatened Areas Abandoned:** This is effectively declaring them uninsurable. Adaptation is protecting capital, not communities. Those accountable to balance sheets are acting; those accountable to voters are stalling.

## The Transformation 

In 2015, 196 nations signed the Paris Agreement. It was the first global commitment to limit warming to 1.5°C. Nine years later, in 2024, fossil fuel consumption hit all-time highs for both coal and natural gas. While the agreement had near-global participation and a ratchet mechanism for increasing ambition, it had no way to constrain what needed constraining: fossil fuel production.

The assumption underpinning the commitment was that countries would gradually align to scale renewables while phasing down their fossil fuel production. And indeed, renewable energy deployment is breaking records—growing 16% in 2024\. But governments also now plan to produce 120% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with remaining below the 1.5°C threshold and 77% more than would be consistent with 2°C. 

The politics are only getting harder. In wealthy democracies, climate action has become a wedge issue for populist movements—framed as an elite preoccupation that threatens jobs, raises energy costs and imposes lifestyle changes on people far from the rooms where the rules get made. For many, opposition has become a marker of cultural defiance.

The fossil fuel industry reinforces division. Lobbying, ad campaigns and political donations keep the arguments circulating. In wealthy nations: “Why go green if China and India are still polluting?” In developing nations: “Why should we leave fossil fuels in the ground when the North never did?”

Trade policy is telling a similar story. The EU's carbon border mechanism is positioned as climate action, but developing countries call it protectionism and China calls it “the new injustice.” The US wields tariff threats to lock allies into long-term gas contracts, which are framed as energy security and criticised as trapping buyers in infrastructure heading toward obsolescence. China's clean energy exports flow through Belt and Road partners as sustainable cooperation—others see a different kind of lock-in. Climate cooperation is happening within blocs, not between them.

Other regions are leveraging the competition. Africa holds nearly 30% of the world's critical minerals—and is no longer willing to export them on the old terms. ASEAN formed its first unified negotiating bloc at COP30.

Meanwhile, climate impacts are accelerating. Heat waves are killing thousands. Floods are erasing towns. Fires are burning through communities in hours. In 2024 alone, disasters triggered 45.8 million internal displacements—nearly double the annual average of the past decade. The World Bank projects up to 216 million people could become internal climate migrants in the next twenty-five years. Early climate action could reduce this figure by 80%, but that window is closing as emissions continue to rise.

Recognition of these new climate realities is forcing a shift in focus from global coordination to building local resilience. Subnational actors, bilateral partnerships and regional networks are stepping in where national governments are not. This more distributed model may prove faster and more adaptive than top-down structures. In Australia, Indigenous fire management practices—systematic, low-intensity burns that reduce fuel loads—are being reintegrated after decades of centralised approaches failed to prevent catastrophic wildfires. Local knowledge, applied locally, is solving problems national policy couldn't.

But local adaptation has a ceiling. At certain combinations of heat and humidity, the human body simply cannot cool itself—no preparation, no infrastructure, no behaviour change can alter the realities of physics. Beyond this line, adaptation isn't a strategy—it's a lottery. These conditions have already occurred, briefly, in South Asia and the Persian Gulf. At 2.5°C of warming, they become routine.

## Strategic Blind Spots 

* **Subnational Actors Lack Reach:** While cities do have underused leverage—procurement, investment, port access, zoning etc., the worst emissions lie beyond local jurisdiction: heavy industry, aviation, shipping, agriculture and energy grids.   
* **Regional Institutions Aren’t Robust:** Most are underfunded, they may lack the staff, the skills and the enforcement mechanisms to respond to increased pressure to meet the demands that climate change impacts are placing on them.  
* **Local Adaptation Shifts Burdens:** Dams secure one region's supply while drying out another. Local resilience can unintentionally create regional fragility and regional conflicts. 

## Global Implications

* **Competition Not Collaboration:** China, the US and the EU each build climate governance into their sphere of influence—Belt and Road, LNG contracts, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Climate action happens, but as strategic competition rather than collective response.  
* **UNFCCC Persists as Governance Migrates:** The forum still convenes but the function of governance moves to trade architecture, bilateral deals, city networks.   
* **Some Can Adapt, Many Can't:** This division becomes a permanent feature of international relations. Rich regions build sea walls; poor regions send refugees. The system stops trying to close the gap and starts managing the flows between them.  
* **The Adaptation Divide:** Those who can't adapt in place move. Those who can adapt build walls—physical and political—to manage arrivals. Migration stops being temporary displacement and becomes permanent redistribution.

## AREAS Strategic Landscape

### Architecting

* China is positioning for market dominance in clean energy hardware, but has shown no appetite for leading on governance—phaseout timelines, climate finance, or ecosystem protection  
* Subnational networks building parallel governance infrastructure (C40, bilateral city partnerships, direct climate finance channels)  
* Industrial policy architects bending cost curves and now dominating supply chains  
* Insurance and reinsurance industry pricing climate risk into markets, effectively redlining regions and forcing adaptation through capital withdrawal

### Resisting

* Petrostates blocking phase-out language at multilateral forums   
* Fossil interests, amplified by political actors, actively undermine public trust in climate science and multilateral processes with coordinated disinformation campaigns  
* Populist movements framing climate action as elite imposition  
* Extraction-as-sovereignty advocates rejecting “green colonialism”

### Exploiting

* Critical mineral holders leveraging new essentiality (Africa's 30%, ASEAN's unified bloc)  
* Hedging petrostates continuing to host COPs while maintaining production, playing both sides  
* Climate finance intermediaries profiting from fragmentation (carbon markets, adaptation consultancies)

### Avoiding

* Communities outside market-integrated energy systems maintaining traditional practices  
* Subsistence economies and informal sectors whose livelihoods don't intersect with formal climate governance  
* Wealthy exit strategists buying or building climate refuges

### Shaped

* Small island states experiencing impacts and abandonment  
* Debt-trapped climate-vulnerable nations financing survival through extraction  
* Indigenous peoples with presence but not participation  
* Populations facing managed retreat—decided by capital withdrawal, not democratic process  
* Agricultural commodity exporters facing yield volatility and supply chain reorganisation they didn't choose

## Scenarios

### New Architecture Emerges

The multilateral system collapses, but new coordinating mechanisms emerge from the wreckage. Regional blocs—ASEAN+, the African Union, Latin American coalitions—build parallel governance systems with actual enforcement mechanisms, replicating China's model of using industrial policy rather than market signals to direct their transitions. Climate finance flows as grants rather than loans, outside IMF/World Bank control, through a new Bretton Woods-style architecture. Technology transfer accelerates through South-South cooperation. Small island nations and climate-vulnerable countries form powerful negotiating blocs that give the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) actual teeth, enabling collective action that shifts their position from Shaped to Resisting to eventually Architecting parts of the new system.

Cities and subnational networks institutionalise their coordination into formal structures with independent finance vehicles. Some fossil fuel producers recognise stranded asset risk and pivot to controlling critical minerals, green hydrogen production, or renewable manufacturing—architecting the energy transition on their terms. What started as local alternatives—community resilience practices, indigenous knowledge systems, parallel currencies—become templates that regional architects incorporate into their frameworks. The system is not universal, but functional for those within the new architecture: emissions fall within regional blocs, climate finance actually flows and vulnerable nations' debt-to-GDP ratios stabilise.

* **Organisations**: Position early within emerging regional blocs—supply chains, standards and partnerships established now will determine access later.  
* **Communities**: Build connections with subnational networks and regional coalitions that are gaining governance capacity outside national frameworks.  
* **Individuals**: Develop expertise in regional systems and South-South networks—career opportunities will follow where coordination actually works.  
* **Advocates**: Support the formalisation of city networks and regional blocs into structures with real enforcement—distributed architecture needs institutional spine.

### Permanent Muddle

Multilateral negotiations continue as theatre while China maintains dominance in renewables supply chains, C40 cities build local resilience and regional powers architect their own zones. None of these organisational groups have incentive to coordinate; they're winning within fragmentation. Fossil fuel producers, populist movements and actors benefiting from the status quo maintain enough power to prevent new multilateral agreements from having impact. They don't need to design an alternative—just prevent change.

This is an optimal scenario for climate finance intermediaries, insurance companies, carbon credit traders and regulatory arbitrageurs. Maximum fragmentation creates maximum profit opportunities and these actors work to maintain just enough coordination to keep markets functioning while preventing the alignment that would eliminate arbitrage. Small nations, indebted countries and vulnerable populations continue existing within severe constraints. Local alternatives work for specific communities but never scale—tolerated as pressure valves but never integrated into broader systems. Adaptation works for wealthy nations; vulnerable regions face repeated disasters without systematic support. Chronic low-grade crisis becomes normalised.

**Adaptive Strategies**

* **Organisations**: Invest in translation capacity—the ability to operate across incompatible systems and profit from gaps between them.  
* **Communities**: Build local resilience that doesn't depend on national or global coordination arriving—it won't.  
* **Individuals**: Bridging skills matter more than deep specialisation; navigating fragmentation becomes the core competency.  
* **Advocates**: Lower expectations for multilateral breakthroughs; focus on incremental wins within blocs and keeping interfaces open.

### Cascading Coordination Failure

Competitive fragmentation proves incapable of coordinating at the scale required. Without emissions reduction, cascading tipping points overwhelm local adaptation capacity faster than it can be built. Climate disasters trigger refugee crises that destabilise regions and increase conflict. Food system failures cascade through global markets. Major emitters turn fully inward, cutting all climate finance and sealing borders.

Even powerful actors find their systems overwhelmed. China's renewable supply chains are disrupted by crop failures and mass migration. C40 cities' adaptation measures prove insufficient against compounding disasters. Regional architecture collapses under refugee flows and resource conflicts. Fossil fuel expansion continues, locking in warming past adaptation limits; political movements resisting climate action prevent emergency mobilisation when it becomes obviously necessary. 

By the time consensus emerges, physical tipping points have passed. When systems collapse, there are no profitable spaces between them—insurance companies that withdrew early preserved capital but have no markets, finance intermediaries find no flows to channel. Small island nations disappear. Climate-vulnerable countries face complete state failure. Refugee populations in the hundreds of millions overwhelm all reception capacity. Communities that built parallel systems retain better resilience than those dependent on collapsed infrastructure, but scale is insufficient. What worked for a village fails for a city.

The point of no return comes when major emitters withdraw from all climate cooperation simultaneously. Once the US, China and EU turn fully inward within the same 2-3 year window, coordination becomes impossible.

**Adaptive Strategies**

* **Organisations:** Build redundancy and local capacity now—those who can operate when supply chains and institutions fail will shape what comes next.  
* **Communities:** Invest in essentials—local food, water, energy and mutual aid networks that function when larger systems don't.  
* **Individuals:** Cultivate practical skills and local ties; when systems fail, immediate geography and tangible capabilities matter most.  
* **Advocates:** Keep climate on the reconstruction agenda—crises create openings for new systems and what gets built in the aftermath locks in for decades.

## Current Signals

**Signal 1: Subnational Actors Institutionalising Climate Action** 

Cities, regions and local authorities are building implementation capacity and finance channels independent of national governments.

**Recent examples:** 

* At COP30, subnational leaders presented over 2,500 bankable local projects to channel climate finance directly—demonstrating delivery infrastructure that bypasses traditional national frameworks. [https://www.c40.org/news/cop30-local-leaders-forum-statement/](https://www.c40.org/news/cop30-local-leaders-forum-statement/)  
* Mumbai became the first Global South city to publish a climate budget in 2024, with 32.18% of its capital expenditure rated as climate-relevant. [https://mcap.mcgm.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/English\_Climate-Budget-Report-2024-25\_compressed.pdf](https://mcap.mcgm.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/English_Climate-Budget-Report-2024-25_compressed.pdf)

**Signal 2: Finance Targets Displacing Emissions Commitments** 

Climate negotiations increasingly focus on money flows rather than decarbonisation pathways.

**Recent examples:** 

* A UNFCCC synthesis of updated NDCs found submitted pledges would reduce emissions by about 17% below 2019 levels by 2035—still insufficient to align with 1.5°C. [https://cop30.br/en/news-about-cop30/2025-ndc-synthesis-report-highlights-momentum-toward-the-climate-transition-and-calls-for-accelerated-global-cooperation-ahead-of-cop30](https://cop30.br/en/news-about-cop30/2025-ndc-synthesis-report-highlights-momentum-toward-the-climate-transition-and-calls-for-accelerated-global-cooperation-ahead-of-cop30)  
* COP30's headline outcome was a $1.3 trillion annual finance commitment by 2035; no new commitments to phase down fossil fuels were secured.

**Signal 3: Climate-Debt Spirals Constraining Vulnerable Nations** 

Climate disasters shrink GDP, drive up debt and trigger credit downgrades—raising borrowing costs precisely when adaptation finance is most needed.

**Recent examples:** 

* Pakistan's 2022 floods caused $30 billion in damages, while the country was already in debt distress. [https://reliefweb.int/report/pakistan/pakistan-floods-2022-post-disaster-needs-assessment](https://reliefweb.int/report/pakistan/pakistan-floods-2022-post-disaster-needs-assessment)  
* Caribbean nations spend up to 5% of GDP on adaptation while carrying debt ratios above 100%. [https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/how-caribbean-building-climate-resilience](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/how-caribbean-building-climate-resilience)

**Signal 4: Trade Policy Integrating with Climate Action** 

Trade measures are being formalised as climate policy instruments within multilateral frameworks.

**Recent examples:** 

* At COP30 in Belém, countries agreed to the first-ever mention of "unilateral trade measures" in a COP negotiated text, establishing three annual dialogues on trade's role in climate action. [https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop30-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-belem/](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop30-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-belem/)  
* The EU's CBAM moves to its definitive phase in January 2026, requiring importers of cement, steel, aluminium, fertilizers, electricity, and hydrogen to purchase certificates based on embedded emissions [https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism\_en](https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en)
